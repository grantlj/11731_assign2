i &apos;m going to talk to you about today to be seen .
i work on the solar system .
and my little friend of mine is going to take us into the environment , and that &apos;s ...
and we think of it as a different source of resources .
this is just a little video about what we &apos;ve done .
it &apos;s a minute .
they can &apos;t afford a little bit .
( laughter ) we just — i just like to feel this sense — i &apos;m just going to take a sense of this video .
no . ( laughter )
( music ) this is not ... ( laughter )
ok . ( laughter )
the sun is technology .
oh , when was it ?
okay . thank you very much .
( applause )
i see you . ( laughter )
i want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing .
we &apos;re going to go to a couple of minutes later , and i hope that if you learn how to do something in your body , you can change the life of life .
we &apos;re very interested in language , especially in the context of other people .
the different forms are always interesting : ( laughter ) and the way that the security and the smile , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , is a pretty good thing .
interviewer : that &apos;s the 10 to close to 10 .
this lucky police will be the best of the <unk> .
and then you don &apos;t — no . ( laughter ) ( applause ) ( laughter ) ( applause )
we &apos;re closed . we &apos;re <unk> .
we &apos;re rented .
we &apos;re trying to be invisible to the man .
you see , the animals and the people are the same things .
and when you look at the power and the sun , it looks like this .
when we have a conversation , we tend to complete their gestures on the other side of the way .
so , if no one &apos;s going to give us the power , we try to tear down , we try to tear it down .
in contrast , we become the power of her .
you know what ?
i saw that the mba students have not been able to have a little bit of the tips .
some of them are leaders of leaders who are leaders who are leaders , they &apos;re sitting in the middle of the highway , they &apos;re going to place them in the middle of nowhere .
and they sit in a few places where they &apos;re sitting there .
they can attack their hands .
they &apos;re invisible .
they &apos;re sitting in their tracks , and they can lift their hands up .
i took a couple of years for me .
the first is that you can &apos;t make it happen .
it turns out that it &apos;s a gender connection .
so women are more likely to be known as more to the law .
it feels like they &apos;re smarter than the men , and they &apos;re smarter than they are .
and it &apos;s actually a lot more likely to be successful .
and it &apos;s very important for these kinds of mba , because it &apos;s the implications for their performance .
the schools are bringing in a lot of schools to make a difference .
and the person who is prepared for the same level and the women are taking the facts , and they see that they &apos;re related to the outcome .
i started thinking , &quot; &quot; oh , i &apos;m starting to think about it , if i can see it in the room , if you can see it in the room .
so if they want these videos to show up their signature , they &apos;ll make it more active in the way they want them ?
and it didn &apos;t seem real to me .
so if we show the very bad news of the short term , how do we feel more powerful in the behavior of the behavior in our behavior ?
now , we know that our parents and our stomach would have been thinking about other people &apos;s thoughts , and there &apos;s a lot of surprises .
but the question that makes us really important to us is that these generic and <unk> are the ultimate manifestation of this .
but we &apos;ve got to be able to smile on the way that we have the rest of the rest of our time .
this should be rejected every two weeks .
it &apos;s good for the power of power .
we become a lot more powerful , though , and we have a little bit of a little bit of gestures that you can do with the forces that are very good at the moment when it &apos;s safe and that it &apos;s safe .
we know that the way we think of our movements are not changing the way we think our movements are changing the way we think our actions are .
how do you think about the feeling of power ?
i think of ideas from ideas and ideas , and i think of the physical things that we &apos;ve made , and i &apos;m learning them .
what does it think of the dangers of ideas ?
it &apos;s not the same thing , but it &apos;s not the only thing that you can imagine , but you can see that it &apos;s not the only thing you &apos;ve seen , the power of the people .
we call them the two holes .
and we offer them to vote .
they &apos;ve got the risk of risk to play .
and it &apos;s 60 percent , but it &apos;s 60 percent .
this is what we &apos;re focusing on on the test .
it &apos;s about 20 percent of the way we &apos;ve come from the past of the past , in the past 20 years , in the last 10 percent of the time in the past , in other countries .
these two transformations are going to be <unk> .
and they &apos;re in trouble .
in 25 percent of the <unk> market , at the end of 25 percent , there are 15 percent increase in their diet .
it &apos;s about two minutes in front of our brain , but it &apos;s going to be a little more challenging , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> feeling .
and these are all of us , right ?
well , we say , &quot; &quot; how do we think and how we think and how we think we can do it ? &quot; &quot; so the stakes are not just about the other ones .
and yet , our minds are changing .
the question that we &apos;re interested in is the question that we can afford to change our lives as much as important for our lives .
this is a 3d <unk> in the lab .
how do you make it in the local life ?
of course , that &apos;s what we really understand .
our ideas can be used in the streets of black , and they can use it in a very dangerous way .
what are we doing ?
and this is the equivalent of the yemen table .
for some of these reasons .
and for some of those things , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to get a job or a job .
and the idea is that you &apos;ve got a lot of interest in your mind , because it &apos;s a lot of your experience .
so we tried to do our recipes , and that &apos;s what they said , and what they said was , &quot; &quot; how do we get to work with a business customer ?
( laughter ) of course , we did this idea . no ! no , no ! we were going to keep this in trouble .
you &apos;re not rational !
this is not about you .
your essence is your third .
you know , before you start to the story ?
sit down . you look at your iphone and android .
you look at your records , and you &apos;re collecting it , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do in your head . and wait a minute .
this is what we wanted to go .
so , when they get to the lab , they get to a laser <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be a very good business player .
it was about five minutes of modest video .
so what they did was , we had to use them to make sure that they had a huge amount of money , but they were not allowed to get rid of their wealth .
it &apos;s more than five minutes on a <unk> level .
nobody thinks that .
the <unk> laser says that called &quot; &quot; stop in a social mess . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the code for conservation .
we &apos;ve spent them in order to see the results .
and then we showed the feedback from these shots .
we were unaware of the images from our glasses .
and they said , &quot; &quot; i want to take care of them . &quot; &quot; and they looked at the <unk> , and they said , &quot; &quot; we want to take these things . &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; we want to take them to work . &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; we want to take them to work .
&quot; &quot; we want to take these things .
and they said more . &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the effect of that ?
it &apos;s not about them .
they &apos;re based on their <unk> .
and we have been able to do other things , and how do you think about it ?
how do they have sex ?
there were no different kinds of events .
what was the point was that they weren &apos;t .
people would show us all the stories .
so they were not able to do it .
they &apos;ve been able to show up their ideas , their signature .
it &apos;s the result of that .
and i wonder if people say , &quot; &quot; well , how do we change our mind , our behavior , our thinking , our behavior , our behavior ?
i &apos;m not really excited about it .
&quot; &quot; i &apos;m not so much .
i would like to feel like i &apos;d been looking at something like this .
i don &apos;t want to be a liar .
i don &apos;t want to be anywhere else .
i &apos;m going to make these words very good . i want to talk to you a little story about &quot; &quot; my hometown , &quot; &quot; as i feel like i &apos;m here .
when i was 19 , i was so heavy , i had a lot of money .
it could be solved .
i was surrounded by a few times .
i played a little bit of a little bit of imagination because i had to leave my arms , and i &apos;ve come to the news , and i &apos;ve got the idea of iq after two seconds , and it was very painful for me .
i had a <unk> , because i was famous for a young boy who was married to her .
and i went back to college , and i tried to go back .
they &apos;re what i call &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; .
the things that can be done , but it &apos;s not the wrong thing . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and so i started doing that . ( laughter ) so i started with this , and i started to say , &quot; &quot; well , what &apos;s the point you &apos;re having , you &apos;re not sure , you &apos;re not going to have any good contact with your hand . &quot; &quot; no matter who you have .
i felt pretty good .
i worked , i worked , i worked on my own , and i won the chance .
i would have a lot of instructions .
four years from my group , four years ago , i had to get to the university of the susan <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which i thought was &quot; &quot; i am not a family . &quot; &quot; so i said , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t belong . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not a family .
i was at the time .
i was a senior in 20 years in princeton and i went back to a sixth grade .
the night was the night .
i was afraid i was going to be so frightened that he would hit a boat , and i said , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; no , you &apos;ll be wondering , you know .
it &apos;s going to be , you know , you &apos;re going to go down , and you &apos;ll be wondering if you &apos;re going to go to the table .
it &apos;s too different .
you &apos;re going to get all the projections that you have to do .
again , again , when i &apos;m scared and you &apos;re horrified and you &apos;re horrified , i think it &apos;s got a lot to say , i have to do it .
it was really inspired by the idea . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m so glad .
five is a high school high school , and i read a high school high school , a few of them , and i &apos;m afraid of it , and i &apos;m going to work there . i don &apos;t think that anymore , but i &apos;m not thinking about this , i &apos;m not thinking about this .
at the end of the freshman , i was at the end of the university , and i said , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t have to work in the class , if you &apos;re going to be honest , if you &apos;re going to be honest , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; you know , you can &apos;t work out if you &apos;re going to go . &quot; &quot; i didn &apos;t know it .
it &apos;s all about the way in which they &apos;re all left , and he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not my way .
this is my point of view .
because two things started .
i first realized that i don &apos;t feel that feeling .
but he was feeling and felt like me .
and the second thing i did was i realized that he was on the ground .
so he could also be able to do it .
and i said , &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s why you &apos;re here !
i &apos;m going to show you the freedom of the morning , and i &apos;m going to show you the best person to go to the site of the audience . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll give you a best version of the day . &quot; &quot; and she did this , and he didn &apos;t know that he was sitting here , and he didn &apos;t know that he was sitting here , and he didn &apos;t know that he was sitting here , but she was so excited about it , and she was
it was changed .
and i would like to tell you , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not sure .
make sure enough .
if you want to be one of the things you want to be , you &apos;ll see it as a person .
i mean , you know what ?
the thoughts come along the way .
so , i said , &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s two minutes . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; well , i want to go to the next two minutes . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; well , i want to go to the next two years .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
and so , when you &apos;re going to make sure that it &apos;s a binary signal , it &apos;s two co2 , it &apos;s two times , you try to do it . you know , in the room , you &apos;re in the room , or it &apos;s in the middle of the door .
you want to go .
be your best at preventing your brain .
increase your treatment . reduce your control .
&quot; &quot; i didn &apos;t know what i was to do for you . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re going to be doing it .
so you can see who i am , and i can show them , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t tell them , &quot; &quot; you know .
i want you to put it on the top of you , to make it happen to other people , because it &apos;s so different .
it &apos;s not <unk> . ( laughter ) so this is what you learned , and you divide it into people , because what technology can be created for people and technology is that people who don &apos;t have the power and power .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do with them .
because the ability to pay attention to their bodies is twice as important to their lives .
thank you .
( applause )
we have so far away .
the worst of them is the invisible .
so , for example , they are the ones that are worth the criteria for us to live .
they came from the majority of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the doors for all the raw things that make the whole thing , the honest and honest , they &apos;re going to do it .
here , in brazil , where 90 percent of the people that are worth it , they &apos;re collecting them .
most of the qatar works . they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
the hydrothermal vents in a few of you may have been a few weeks ago , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> .
and that &apos;s the reason i had met with this <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m a graffiti artist and an activist , and i &apos;m really interested in social issues , politics and environmental protection .
in 2007 , i took away from the walls of my own work , from the wall to the vents .
but i was going to support these books .
it took me a lot of attention to my work and the soft , and i &apos;d like to talk about the fact that they were able to put those plates into attention to their diet .
they &apos;re famous for me in the united states and in social media .
so , i mean , i &apos;ve always been involved in this world since i &apos;ve met this world .
i had a lot of escape from the 200 people , and i was invited to a lot of exhibitions and around the world .
and i realized that , by the way they &apos;re invisible , they &apos;re not only brazil , but we don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve come to them in the middle of the country , in the country , in south africa , in the country , in the country , in the u.k. .
and so i realized that there was more people going to be more like this , because this was the big deal .
and then i &apos;ve created a movement under the title of &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) — it was a movement that could be used by the international capital .
thank you .
( applause )
i mean , it was a huge movement in the international community that was created by the fate of the black and <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> professionals , and they were encouraged by providing services to health services .
also , we were also able to give them a sense of danger and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to see them .
they also have other options to do : the lenses , the chemicals , the signals and the water .
and then finally , with a few artists , i was able to paint the pictures , and they would be part of the great art exhibition .
the são paulo , <unk> <unk> , came out of rio de janeiro and <unk> .
but we &apos;ve created a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
so , let &apos;s see it .
it was 170 years ago , 170 black and 200 pounds , and it was 100 times a year , and it &apos;s gone from the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; and then he went to the &apos; 90s .
now they &apos;re going to be <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be able to put the data in the back , and then people would give up .
they were able to come up with the idea that they could be filmed by a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
now , i &apos;m going to show you a little <unk> and a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
try to see the world as the kind of thing and the fact that we don &apos;t have the cells .
there &apos;s no longer person in the world , it &apos;s about 20 million in the world .
recognize that when you see somebody in the eye , you recognize them as a life of our society .
<unk> <unk> , thank you .
( applause )
five <unk> , in 1990 , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who came to place in the <unk> of the <unk> liberal school — was the leader of the palestinian school leader .
the nobel prize was a <unk> known as the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
he &apos;s been obsessed with the plan for the farmer .
but unfortunately , in the 19th century , the world trade was not the size of the bomb .
and in the end , it was the only <unk> in the <unk> .
well , it &apos;s my favorite note .
in 1990 , pennsylvania , when i was in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who had never been able to live happily ever in life .
after the age of age , the arts started to change in our lives .
my father , a lot of people , had a lot of me to see that he had a very little bit of a human being .
i &apos;ve learned about this , and i &apos;ve learned about that , and when i think about people as a person , you know , it &apos;s very , very long , and every time we see somebody &apos;s life , they &apos;re all very different .
in fact , in any context , every single one of them has a little bit of money , and it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s safe for the people who will be able to keep them alive for their own lives .
he gave me a few months ago when he threw me down in the middle of a couple of weeks ago , and he was telling me that he was going to be in a classroom called <unk> in london .
and he told me that i was going to go through it .
we called the <unk> police , and we didn &apos;t know that it was in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle .
so , in my tea , my father went to keep me in my inner village , and he was able to get how much it could cost to 30 years .
the last day i took a day of the day , the little devil was on the surface , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , which i did .
and i said , &quot; &quot; wow . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; the horse &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; the horse &quot; &quot; .
it was a gift to me , and i laughed , and after all , i understood what they were laughing at .
they thought they were seeing the terror that i did .
and so the people knew that there was only a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a million years ago , and that was the equivalent of the 6 <unk> <unk> , which is the equivalent of six to five or a half people worldwide .
these people are free .
&quot; &quot; oh , &quot; &quot; — i was the people that i called the key .
i was 19 years old , and we changed the way we live in my childhood , and that &apos;s why my parents had been born with me .
who &apos;s going to be lost in the next few years , and i &apos;m going to have no other person else .
as a new person , i &apos;d be a kid in the world , and i was surrounded by children .
i had a secret to my identity , and i would hide my identity , and i would say , &quot; &quot; oh , you know , it &apos;s the same thing that you &apos;re going to have , and you &apos;ve got to have new york , and you &apos;ve got to be <unk> .
so i spent a lot of time in my home home , watching books and tvs and playing .
and i had a lot of hostility in my social communication , and i wasn &apos;t really sure that one of the women in the family was living in real life .
i have grown up in a sense that people who have been inspired by the human and human rights act .
what was my eyes ?
one of my first experiences that i thought was that i was in the early year of early 2000s .
i earned the accident for a <unk> program at the university of preparation for <unk> .
the group that i was in was a group of people who were in the media , had a lot of attention to the violence , and i was not sure what was going to be the most important thing about the violence of the survival of the children .
the idea of our group was the people who had been able to live different lifespans .
i learned that the last day i was born on the afternoon , one of the kids that i was friends .
this was a few days ago , but i realized that there was no way to believe in the united states of the enlightenment .
i didn &apos;t have a family , and i said , &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;ve heard the story that i &apos;ve heard about the rest of my life .
and one more transformation , i found , was that i had a lot of time for a lot of time in the park , and that &apos;s what i found in my bedroom to make a lot of profit .
and here i was in the study of people who had different beliefs and bodies , and that was the way that i experienced my imagination .
i &apos;ve learned that a lot of my life is the power of homosexuality , and i hope it has the whole capacity for all the rest of the rest .
and i realized that , at some point , i &apos;ve had to be able to work with gene engineering at all , and i &apos;ve seen some of the most vulnerable people in the audience .
i love , you know , a person who &apos;s a very interesting person , a person who has a lot of faith in me , is to say , &quot; &quot; well , what &apos;s going to happen to me ? &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , what &apos;s the case ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s another one of the other things that i love to do .
i was able to make the story of what i learned from the truth of my childhood , how to make the real life experience of life .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a sense of what it &apos;s like to be , because i &apos;m very interested in what &apos;s happening to you , because what &apos;s happening is that you don &apos;t have any part of it .
and then he said , &quot; &quot; the bouncy castle . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m going to be honest with the stephen <unk> . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; i want to tell you about what it &apos;s like to be honest or religious and gender that &apos;s not just the way it is .
and i had a lot of stress , and at the moment i needed the stress , i needed to know what was going on in front of me .
the inspiration was coming up to the very long time , and it wasn &apos;t the answer to me , and it wasn &apos;t the score , but it was not even worse , but it didn &apos;t hit me .
one day , i had a conversation about the world that i was seeing in the world , and my mother told me that i couldn &apos;t take out of my life .
my mother said , &quot; &quot; i had a friend of mine who had died , and i had a friend of mine , and she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m sorry to hate people .
i understood how much value i would have to get a sense of hatred of a moment of faith .
my parents are not real .
i decided to start my step into the new life of my family .
why would i be able to express myself ?
it &apos;s quite remarkable .
i hope that , in a way , i would say that , as a matter of case , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; no matter what it &apos;s worth , maybe it &apos;s my husband , &quot; &quot; and i think there &apos;s a lot more intuitive , and i &apos;m not sure , i don &apos;t have the privilege to get away from the anthropologist .
so , i chose to experience the experience of life that i won , which i &apos;ve been talking about , and i &apos;ve been doing a term that i &apos;m talking about .
i &apos;m going to take this out of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to argue that i &apos;m not going to take the risks that are going on , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing in the face of this remarkable activity .
i mean , what i &apos;m talking about is that you know , as a consultant , a <unk> , a <unk> , and i &apos;m not sure that the son doesn &apos;t have to go to the road for the past .
i &apos;m not the horse .
thank you very much . ( applause ) thank you one . ( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
your head is no !
you ?
they took it to me , and i wanted to ask you to ask , &quot; &quot; i want to ask you to ask . &quot; &quot; now , what would you say ?
anybody ? anybody ? no , no problem .
i was sitting in a restaurant , and i was sitting in the restaurant , and i was eating it .
i looked at my office and said , &quot; &quot; you have the world ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter )
he looked at me a weird way to think about what he was talking about .
he said , &quot; &quot; donate ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get it . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; you know what ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; i know . &quot; &quot; &quot; i know . &quot;
he said , &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; come , come on , come on . come on .
he was inspired by me . he said , &quot; &quot; if you have the most popular girl in this world , i &apos;m not sure . &quot;
&quot; &quot; why don &apos;t we say &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; ?
she was exposed to a young girl who had a young boy who had never met her , and she was fighting .
so , how could it be able to do this ?
i started thinking about it .
that made me feel .
this is a man &apos;s book !
they can &apos;t accept me as i speak in my country .
is it going to go elsewhere ?
how did we get here ?
but we &apos;ve got a lot of people here , and i have a lot of people here in their life , and they &apos;ll just pick them up and say , &quot; &quot; well , it &apos;s just that it &apos;s possible and it &apos;s just that it &apos;s a struggle , but it &apos;s not just that it &apos;s possible for them to say that it is possible to make them feel like it &apos;s possible .
i have to forget my whole civilization , my ideas and the loss and the opportunities ?
we were able to have the best ones that we were doing in the early stages of childhood .
i &apos;ve learned that in arabic , i &apos;m just going to sleep every single thing .
should i forget to be one of them ?
here &apos;s the indian army here ?
and i looked at all of that , and i tried to start it .
i didn &apos;t want to engineer him as a rabbi .
the arabic language is not going to answer the day .
it &apos;s not the language of the science , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;ve used in the universities , which we &apos;re doing in our universities , and that &apos;s not the language that we &apos;ve used in the harbor .
if we had to , if they were , we would put our pants on .
i don &apos;t have to use my tongue in ? &quot; &quot; we &apos;re giving us this thing !
you want , you know , use the arabic language . we need to use it .
it &apos;s an image .
but there &apos;s another possibility that we need to think about .
the arabic language is a key language .
it &apos;s not research that you can &apos;t be able to be perfect in the language language than to be in a language language .
in the language language , in the language of globalization , it is the way that you can express the ideas in the other languages .
how ?
china is the first time when he &apos;s writing a chinese <unk> factory .
his whole idea of all of the ideas , the ideas and the philosophy of the whole , was a little boy from the village in the country .
so when she started writing this english language , he had her life .
in fact , when you read english in her english language , you &apos;d feel confident that you could feel pregnant .
you can imagine that , in the english language , the author is the guy who comes in the english language , and she &apos;s a son who comes from the mountains .
this is a myth that no one &apos;s ever told .
second , it &apos;s often not that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill her language .
this is a way that a mission is invented .
germans , french , posters , chinese — these nations are different .
and so this is why they &apos;re protecting their languages .
they &apos;re doing it .
so they pay a lot of money to get the language out of the language , and they pay a lot of money to make language .
do we know more about them ?
well , we &apos;re not going to come up with the world , but we don &apos;t have to come up with the world , and we want to leave the world with us .
and as a matter of fact , when they went to the lab and <unk> and <unk> , who lived with their bodies , they were able to take their language , and they were able to take their language , and when they were released , they would not have gotten their hands in .
they kept on their tongue .
because if you take a seat from turkey and another person , and if you don &apos;t have a sticker , it doesn &apos;t mean it , it &apos;s not enough .
you couldn &apos;t believe that it was a place .
they were the recipients , and they &apos;re incredibly familiar with who we are in time .
so they have to preserve their language and be able to protect themselves .
if i say , &quot; &quot; minority and accountability , &quot; &quot; ( applause ) and what would this remind you of ?
what does it mean ?
so , who can &apos;t look at it .
language is not the case that the words are coming from our mouth , not necessarily the way to talk .
language is the only one that we have in our lives , and it &apos;s not the ability that we have our connection to our mission .
so , when we say , &quot; &quot; minority , the accountability , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minority , &quot; &quot; you think , in each of you , you think , especially when they look at each other , they &apos;re particularly specific in particular , especially in history .
language is two , two or three words , not just a combination of it .
it is the claim that we think about each other , how we can connect each other and how we see each other .
what is intel ?
you know how , this is the human mind , or don &apos;t it ?
so if i say , &quot; &quot; minority and accountability , you &apos;re a <unk> . &quot; &quot; and if your son came to say , &quot; &quot; throw it , you &apos;re a minority , you know ? &quot;
what do you feel ?
if you don &apos;t see the problem , i &apos;m going to come up and i don &apos;t speak to empty space .
and in this case , this expression tells us something special .
i have a <unk> friend of mine .
i asked one day , how does it work ?
he said , &quot; &quot; everything is good . it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) so the summer , he wrote a book called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; for the last night , and he said , &quot; &quot; tom <unk> , &quot; &quot; he then says , &quot; &quot; tom <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then he said to her the whole night .
his wife had been hungry , and they said , &quot; &quot; how could it be so many times ?
is it wanting to hurt ?
&quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; this is one of a few miles .
so we started thinking , well , when the woman doesn &apos;t handle it , the woman doesn &apos;t know the word , and it &apos;s really cool to deal with it . it &apos;s a different way of thinking .
and he said , &quot; &quot; well , that &apos;s me , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; oh , that &apos;s me , i &apos;m going to spend a lot of my time listening to my wife , and i &apos;ve tried to translate it for a while . &quot; &quot; so i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to take my hands out of them . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve gone away from them . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and that &apos;s the problem , &quot; &quot; and i
take it for me .
( applause ) what did we do to protect the arab language ?
we started this to the front of the community of our community , and we started campaigning for the arabic language .
and yet , a lot of people would say , &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t you ?
forget about that success , and for you . &quot; &quot; no problem !
and the arabic language of the arabic campaign , which was , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m talking to you from the picture , and i &apos;ll give you a sacrifice .
we said , &quot; &quot; no ! we do it and we accept it . &quot; &quot; we didn &apos;t choose this way , because it didn &apos;t go to the road .
and i think in that way , when i speak to that , i &apos;m arabic arabic .
we say , ( applause ) we want to change our role and we want our actions , our desire , our desire and our daily life .
we &apos;re going to be the way we think about who we are and who we think .
so i thought , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m a girl from the photo , but you can &apos;t tell me how awesome you can .
very simple , in the same time , creative and belief .
and then we started a different campaign on the ground .
you &apos;ve seen this neuron in a number of letters , the black and yellow side , which is a letter from the ceremony .
why ? well , it &apos;s killing .
we shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
if we were to kill our language , we would be our identity .
we were going to be <unk> .
we were going back to the beginning .
it &apos;s a matter of serious luck to get the chance to become an architect and an engineer .
and then we put the pictures in arabic , the boys and the girls .
girls &apos; images and girls &apos; photos .
we &apos;re very high .
and who says , &quot; &quot; aha , you &apos;ve got english , &quot; &quot; i say , &quot; &quot; no ! i don &apos;t have a word &apos; &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; oh ! i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; oh , you know , how long it does it .
i &apos;ll continue to say &quot; &quot; the internet . &quot; &quot; and i say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to get the world for the world . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) because that &apos;s not what we should be taking .
but what we have to do is to believe that if you think about it , if we &apos;re going to say , if you &apos;re going to say that , what we &apos;re going to do is not to give us the bigger ones that we have , and we think that they want us to do it , and they think about what they want .
it &apos;s about being creative .
if we don &apos;t know how to fly into the universe , or if we don &apos;t know the rocket , we can be creative .
you are a creative audience .
it &apos;s a very simple way of creativity in your language language .
let &apos;s start with this moment .
let me make a novel novel , or a short film .
and there &apos;s a lot of novel robots .
this is a arabic <unk> .
he says , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no way to go . &quot; &quot; there &apos;s crazy .
but we need to know , and we have to believe that there &apos;s a way to go and be part of the emergence of a thousand .
and finally , what do you do today ?
&quot; &quot; <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> ?
and in my case , if i save a lot of you , i want you to go to school , you know , you &apos;re in the english language or the french or chinese .
but don &apos;t write a group of books from the arabic language in arabic .
( applause ) this is disaster . it &apos;s not language .
you &apos;re getting rid of the digital world with you .
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s easy to get back from a place .
this is the first thing we can do .
second , there &apos;s a lot of other things we can do .
we &apos;re not collecting that today to believe us .
so we &apos;re here to be careful what we call the conservation council .
now , let me tell you one .
it &apos;s the first time that you get your tongue back to the tongue .
in my daughter , she &apos;s going to tell me , &quot; &quot; this is your ancestor , <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i work him for the english , &quot; &quot; the great job , &quot; &quot; the job is &quot; &quot; the great job , &quot; &quot; the great job , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the great thing &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; and i &apos;m not going to hope it , and i &apos;m not going to tell him that i &apos;m not going to say it
( applause ) come back to the front of the body .
a couple of years ago , this was the u.s. <unk> <unk> , which was a couple years ago .
so i learned a few things that i &apos;ve learned about 30 days ago .
the months before the months was coming down , it was more likely to get married .
so i took a picture of a month , a day , and a day .
i didn &apos;t start to go back to 30 days ago .
i also learned that i didn &apos;t know how much it was .
by the way , this is the way that you can &apos;t write a piece of paper .
but you &apos;re going to end the rome .
it &apos;s so nasty .
i don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m a <unk> album . &quot; &quot;
no , if i want to say , &quot; i &apos;m writing . &quot;
i learned that i could have no longer , no matter , no matter how to be there .
in fact , they &apos;re very fun .
( applause )
so , the first day i started to university , i was able to use hope and optics that the first day i started to university .
and when i was reading the school , i was high school , i was high school , and i began to feel like i was born with my wife and my wife and my wife and the son of her husband .
this was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> image of his husband .
and <unk> , i &apos;m afraid , i &apos;m scared , i &apos;m scared , i &apos;m scared of men , including men , including men , including men and women .
but i was learning how to hide these fears .
and it was so amazing that it was the most impressive thing about it , and i was even aware of that in the first place , and i was able to end up with the first time , first of all .
and when i started thinking about who , as i started , as a result , as a result , when i got out of my life , my husband was sitting at the time , and i went back and forth .
no one who had been in my blog . i wish i had heard about the light and the experience .
it &apos;s a little bit easier , though , when you put it on the chip , you put it in the garage .
&quot; &quot; he opens the door . &quot; &quot; — i was equal .
it was a beginning . it would sound sound .
and before the days before , i realized that all the dylan had to do anything to me was the third man .
&quot; he is ready to be ready . &quot;
the sound of the sound , the calm , even even a matter of fact , is an hour and a result , and i also have an idea , which is that i think i don &apos;t give it to you , it &apos;s the <unk> that i don &apos;t give .
in the course of the nation , i had a lot of my dreams and my feeling , and i felt like i was in a school where i was a school , and i felt like i would have my dreams .
i was always struck by all the time , and i felt like , i felt confident that i had a lot of my hands on my own , and i felt confident that i was working on my hands , and i had no hope that i was working on my hands .
i talked to my talk about my wife , and she came out .
and this turns out to be an example : the people of the people are mad , and my wife was serious .
it was a little bit scary . ( laughter ) so i got to my head , and i came to the head of the second world .
i &apos;m a rabbi <unk> .
and my goat , i &apos;ve found that i &apos;m a little bit more confident that i &apos;m going to take a lot of faith in my mind , and that &apos;s what i call the <unk> , which is the sound that i have to do with my voice .
i had the idea of this , and i needed to wonder , and i needed to know , i started to mentor myself .
what i thought i was going to do was the sound of the sky .
i was <unk> <unk> , and i was told you could also look at the sound of the sound of the sound , and then you could look at it .
for example , i was working on the television of the journal david <unk> , and i spent the last few months working with my wife , and i said , &quot; &quot; i want to go , i &apos;m gonna go .
i &apos;m not going to read about it . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not going to read about it . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not going to read about it . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know .
and then he started to go after the process .
i was sick in the hospital , and the next one was the female <unk> , and then the worst one , and then , the worst thing that comes to me with my life and the future is that i have a sense of hopelessness .
the sound of the sound that i &apos;ve been equal to me is not just the experience of life , and i &apos;m afraid that i &apos;m scared , and i &apos;m afraid that i &apos;m scared , and i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m scared .
this is the view of the view of the city , which is a phenomenon of a phenomenon , which is a result of a number of sounds , and it starts to be honest , and it &apos;s going to be more honest and more honest .
i &apos;m going to make you a little <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , in this world .
so , for example , i thought it was a little bit about how to change the experience of what it is that i think is going to change my life , and that it &apos;s kind of started to look for some kind of a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
first of all , you have a series of parties to get out of three , three more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> . ( laughter )
you see the current response ?
and i was able to use that water , and i would say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve done this .
in fact , i was afraid , and i was afraid , and i had no idea , and it was a cruel transformation to humanity , and that i had no hope , and i wasn &apos;t in charge , and i was not in the biosphere 2 .
two years later , i started breathing .
i &apos;ve been able to go to all the rest of my life : the harsh sounds , the rays and images , and so on , and so forth , and so on , and so on .
the spirit of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , became a catalyst for physical and <unk> , and i was my boss , and she said that he was more comfortable than he was . &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s got a lot of fun . &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s got a lot of fun .
now , i think that in the past , in the beginning , i think , in a way , a death of an early age , one of the people , one of them is infected .
he was sitting in a <unk> and a <unk> , and he was going to get out of the room , and she was going to go back to a picture i was supposed to be .
my life has been very , very human , and i &apos;ve been pregnant with them , and they &apos;re all about the fact that i have a lot of help with the people who have helped me .
i &apos;m the other voice , and i &apos;m tired , and my partners and my partners and my partners , and i believe that there is a tremendous amount of time that i believe that i &apos;m going to take away from my mother , who &apos;s believed that i &apos;m going to go to him , and i &apos;m going to take a moment to see if i can &apos;t afford it , but i &apos;m not sure how much i could afford in the past four years , i would say , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t
i believe that eleanor will do that .
sometimes there &apos;s a lot of trouble on the chest , as the wife comes up . &quot; &quot; and he was 14 years old , and he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not going to thank you . &quot; &quot; and i was 14 years old and i went back to the museum , and i was able to thank you , thank you , i &apos;d come back to my beautiful <unk> .
but they came to them in a way that they &apos;re not going to be in , and they &apos;re in a <unk> , <unk> soul .
i would say , &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; well , i would say , &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;m going to tell you , i &apos;m always going to talk to you , i &apos;m going to talk to you , and i &apos;m going to talk about the fact that i &apos;m going to talk to you , and i think that i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to talk to you , i think it &apos;s the world &apos;s moral issues that i think i &apos;m talking about
of course , first of all , i thought , well , it was hard to believe that the sounds of the sound came and thought , and i thought , &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;m going to try and tell you a little bit about my life , but i want to try and try to change my life .
for example , i thought that my voice was going to be my voice , and i didn &apos;t have the same kind of joy that i had ever seen , and i felt that i had to feel the feeling of love and danger in my life .
i believe in them .
i &apos;ve just spent a couple of weeks sitting in front of my leaders who are sitting in the door of the museum , making them real .
so , in the course of many years , i had a lot of attention tools , which was a lot of attention to my own , but i was sitting in the room , and there was something like that .
you know , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t work with me .
i mean , i mean , i mean , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to say .
and then i started thinking , &quot; &quot; oh , you know , the way i &apos;m going to take the next door is to make a lot more ethical and more important than i am . &quot; &quot; ( applause ) and i thank you for what they &apos;re experiencing in danger , because when you stand up and feel , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in front of them .
so when i put the sounds back , i started to ask them , &quot; &quot; well , you know , i &apos;m going to give you an answer , &quot; &quot; and i started to make sure that we wanted to teach us how to support .
i &apos;ve learned that all of this is happening in every single sequence of the sound and all the time , and we &apos;ve learned that there is a certain amount of magnitude , human nature , shame and shame and nature .
and i discovered that the sounds of these wounds were replaced by words , saying , &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;m discovered that i think that &apos;s the most important thing i &apos;ve ever heard of and the sound of the sounds of the sounds .
after that , i thought , i &apos;m not sure , i &apos;m standing in front of you , where i &apos;m standing in front of the mountains , and i &apos;m going back to the <unk> , and i &apos;m back in the world , and i &apos;ve got to go back to psychology .
for the first time , after the sound of the sound , i think that , in the history of the university , the university would come up with the highest degree of psychology in the history of university , and then after a year , i got the highest degree centigrade .
and i thought , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to be an american girl .
i think of it as a matter of course , in the world .
who called the <unk> .
( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( applause ends ) i think we need to look at the two conversations about the second time .
i &apos;ve been working on the health care service , the books of the book , and i keep doing stuff .
all the time i &apos;m listening to them , i &apos;ve learned to live with peace , and i have learned to live with the peace and mercy of compassion .
i &apos;ve been able to help other people to come to the country that i &apos;ve been doing most of the time in the morning .
now , you know , you &apos;ve got to remember , you know , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the world , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the hard , the most valuable and important way that it has to learn .
i mean , i mean , i mean , you know , you can imagine that you &apos;re going to be able to support these things , and you think about it , that you have the courage and the ideas and the people that are affected by their voice .
this is an impossible process , and it &apos;s now being built .
there &apos;s a <unk> statement that we can &apos;t go back if we start to change the social change .
it &apos;s not supposed to take the man .
it doesn &apos;t happen to be people who aren &apos;t afraid .
for me , the sound of the sound is not only about the justice , the state of the state , and the fact that the government is not just the words , but the value that the world has to be changing .
in the last 20 years , the sound of sound is five and a half years old , and it works in the country , and the people who are struggling with their work , they will expand the opportunity to the people , the hope and the <unk> , and the fact that our activity is to be human .
who is the foundation of the internet , which is the human psyche , the human psyche .
from that perspective , one of the biggest images for our society is that we have to help people who have needed to be able to defend them , to be able to help us , to be able to stay , to get their hands and to be able to defend .
we need to be able to survive and be able to survive .
we &apos;re unique . we &apos;re going to be not .
it &apos;s not going to take us away from our apartment , and we cannot do it .
light is not .
once a woman who told me , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t tell me what other people are looking for .
it &apos;s based on your head . &quot; &quot; thank you very much .
( applause )
i &apos;m here to talk about my photography .
but is this picture ?
because , of course , it &apos;s not a picture that you can take with your camera .
and yet , my marathon , photography , 15 years old , started when i took my first prototype .
i joined it with my <unk> , which was a painter , but in a different way , because i was able to plan the process of using prostate cancer .
when you take a picture of the photons , it &apos;s ready to get a piece of light .
so for me , photography was not just the right place in the right place .
i thought it would be like this .
i wanted to create a different thing , which is something that it &apos;s starting to be after after the picture was taken .
and this is the pictures that are going on in the road in a way .
but it &apos;s been <unk> .
and by looking at this , it looks very close .
or this is how photography — the dark , the color , is still the color , but it is going to be a direct movement to keep the challenge .
let &apos;s see how we can reform .
because , of course , these are not just images that we &apos;re going to have , but i want to think that the images that we can see in the camera are not the images .
i want you to have a few ideas that are going to be able to deal with the village .
so it &apos;s more likely to hold more public control than it does .
is that good news to the fact that it doesn &apos;t seem to be real ?
is it a way to do with these kinds of detail or with color ?
is it about the light ?
what about the illusion ?
sometimes <unk> <unk> .
but at the end , how do we think about the earth , how do you get that three-dimensional ?
this is not about what &apos;s really going to be , but what we &apos;re seeing is what &apos;s really going to happen .
so the core is quite simple .
i see this in a way that i &apos;m doing some of the things i &apos;m doing , which is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
let me show you an example .
here are the three things that we have in the physical world , with the three-dimensional <unk> , the <unk> .
but when someone gets together , they see the <unk> obese species .
we also know that we can &apos;t exist .
so we &apos;re playing games with our brain , because our brain doesn &apos;t even have the brain to be able to do it .
and i see the same picture as a picture .
this is actually a way to combine different realities .
so a picture of musical performance , i think , is something that i don &apos;t think about , in our everyday lives , things that are around us .
and it &apos;s really important to take this picture , and it &apos;s really important to get it on the ground , but in fact , it looks like it &apos;s in a way .
what i want to say is that there are three dimensions that we have to do for a real outcome .
and you see , these images don &apos;t have a special effect .
but when it comes together , it looks something like this .
so in the first case , the images of the united nations should be the same thing .
secondly , the images of the united states must be the same .
and in these two images , these two images are seen — they &apos;re the same as high , and the light is taken in light .
and third , it &apos;s the kind of <unk> that you can see if you can see the shape of the shape , the one that you can see , where the other starts .
it &apos;s the way that you can see the shape of how the shape is made .
we can &apos;t see the images between the images of the different images , the controls , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> of the various different images that we see in the different ways , which is that , in some sense , there &apos;s hundreds of lines .
this is another example .
( laughter ) people can think that this is a picture of a landscape , and it can be thought that it was an area of land .
but in fact , this picture is happening in the way that the images of the different places come together .
i think it &apos;s more likely to create a space that i think is more than a place , or you can &apos;t even change your claims .
but that &apos;s a lot of computation .
and i thought this was a couple of months , and i knew that there was a couple of months , and i knew that there was a couple of months , and i knew that there was a few months to get around the world .
for example , the picture of the fish is taken by the fish .
they are different stories .
it &apos;s taken in six feet of water .
and i &apos;ve painted red , and i &apos;ve just had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of sweden .
so it &apos;s possible for a long time to get a lot closer and bigger .
it &apos;s going to start with a doodle .
and then you get different images together .
so this is a piece that &apos;s a lot of good plan .
and if you &apos;re going to take pictures of it , it &apos;s very nice , and it can be quite a very complex thing .
so there are all the lawyers that we need , and the only thing that is imposed on us is our imagination .
thank you .
( applause )
chris anderson : julia , you &apos;re very good .
and it was a certain amount of information , which is the fact that the entire world has been more than the information that the entire world is published .
is it possible ?
julian assange : yes , it &apos;s possible to do that ?
the rest of the world &apos;s global warming is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> group , to make more of it than the whole world of technology .
ca : so how do you do that ?
how do people do this ?
how does the net bridge ?
ja : so , as we know it , it &apos;s a series of people who have a certain leak , and they have different ways to play us .
so we can &apos;t be able to take a look for granted , to be comfortable in the internet to make sure that we &apos;re on the web , to give up the law , to make the case to protect the law .
it &apos;s the way that we can create the password and the name of it , and the name of it , as it looks like , it &apos;s called a <unk> , where it &apos;s called a <unk> — it &apos;s a little bit hard to make — it &apos;s a little bit difficult to make , but it &apos;s a little bit difficult to make sure that it is possible for the future and the political cause .
ca : so , you know , it &apos;s the basis of what &apos;s going to happen to the government . you don &apos;t know who is there , but you don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to be there .
ja : it &apos;s true . we recognize them in rare , if we &apos;re able to take the entire world to the public .
( phone ) ( applause )
( laughter ) ca : i think it &apos;s <unk> . the question is asking the code of the queen . ( laughter )
and i think there &apos;s some reason why i think we can do it .
this is a <unk> set of years ago .
this is an example .
it was a story from kenya .
how do you learn about the story ?
ja : this is a <unk> recession .
after the year of 2004 , kenya was elected by the government government .
in the years of kenya , in kenya , the world was dominated by the arab arab and the year since the year .
it was a museum in the world .
with the power of <unk> , they began to take two million dollars on average , starting with a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and the government has been able to create political power to kenya in the world , and that &apos;s the most powerful man who has ever been .
kenya is the holy book of california .
in 2007 , i was able to go from the 28 3,000 years ago to the world , and i had the same idea .
this is the calculated world , which is the new era of the arab arab spring , and then we started writing about two days after that , and after the rest of this year , the president of jerusalem had become <unk> .
ca : so long ago , the short story was not in the press , but the way it was done by the way , and you think , you know , this is the end of these elite .
ja : yes . news is the first time in the early world , and then in the countries around the kenya , the landscape and the africa has been discussed .
the news came from the news .
and in a few days , kenya kenya is starting to write a story about it .
after 20 days , it was published on the planet in kenya , and the world &apos;s security has changed the ten percent of the security service in the world , and that leads to the implications of elites .
ca : so the information that you &apos;d like to do is change the world ?
ja : yes .
( applause ) ca : so this is a video about the air of the air in the west .
video is a little bit tall . this is a short clip .
i just say , i have a little bit of violence in this video .
raisuddin : ... one , a lot of them .
now they see , they see it .
it &apos;s <unk> . waste .
it &apos;s the story . you see it .
he &apos;s his wife .
<unk> , <unk> .
( hunting <unk> ) boom . boom , boom .
hotel , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ve got to go down .
we &apos;ve killed , eight years old .
there are two conditions , we continue to fire .
he did . he died .
tweet , we &apos;re in the world , twitter .
ooh . donate . what ?
what , the world .
ca : so , how did this video be ?
ja : the people who were hand is heavy .
it was sent two years to look at the video with this video .
this is one of the three children in the video .
ca : so , when you have an event in your cell phone , two of them died in two years ?
ja : yes . two workers worker died , two wounded wounded .
and in the hope , i &apos;ve lost 20 years of man .
ca : so this is what makes them publish .
so , you know , how many of you are and how many of you are ?
ja : i don &apos;t know , i think people have seen a lot of power .
so with the gravitational pull , we &apos;re not going to have a plane flying over the rest of the people — 300 years old — not just for any reason .
there were two scenarios that were very large , and they had the two things that they were doing .
ca : it was <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was known as the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is it true ?
ja : we have this denial that we &apos;ve written .
after five days , he &apos;s got 150 years ago when he was 150 .
we were published in this first series of paintings of art , which was published , and we didn &apos;t see them .
i had this epiphany .
ca : if you were able to design the diplomatic sector of the united states ?
ja : so we were publishing them . ( ca : did we do this ? ) ja : what ?
there are these kinds of rituals that are hidden .
ca : so , a little bit of a <unk> , a little bit of a <unk> .
in the hope , is it reflected in the ideology of hope ?
now , what would you like to call the adoption papers ?
ja : so there &apos;s a question that we have to do for the world , the way that the human imagination has to be able to restore the disease .
it &apos;s very , very quickly .
the power of the economy to economic power is to be able to make sense of what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be good enough for us to go to , and how many of you know what &apos;s going on .
in the principle , it happens all the time in the history of california .
ca : but not just a few danger , but when you have a leak , you can &apos;t even get rid of you all the time for all of the community , even if all of you have the product .
ja : what we &apos;re doing is not necessarily the way we do .
so we &apos;ve got political protection from the ground .
there are some of the people who are able to do it , and we &apos;re publishing in front of them .
there &apos;s a law that has a law that has a lot of laws — like this , where the patient is protected with the law , and we &apos;re working with the news that we know what it really does .
ca : so , sure , it &apos;s good .
if you can zoom in to one person in the united states , and you say , &quot; &quot; you know , you know , what is it that you &apos;re trying to do ?
the people of the american show show that they laugh .
it shows that the human history of millions of people in the world will not be human .
i don &apos;t have my son . what are you going to do ? &quot; &quot; what would you do ?
ja : so these things are very likely .
but don &apos;t matter if there are , in the west , the people in afghanistan , they don &apos;t need to see this video . they see them every day .
it &apos;s not the idea of their opinion . it &apos;s not the art , it &apos;s not a sense of their opinion .
they see every day .
it &apos;s going to change the role of people who pay for a chance to make it , but it &apos;s our radio .
ca : so you &apos;re not going to have the same way of government and corporations in light of the hidden signals .
it &apos;s good to light .
but what &apos;s odd is that , because of the way to light the orders , you have to hide the barriers to light themselves .
ja : well , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s not necessarily a <unk> .
or we don &apos;t have the tools that are not going to happen .
if they are , and they &apos;re very difficult to do , we can work for them , and we &apos;re working with them , and the people who are working with us , they &apos;re trying to help us to help them go to our own work .
ca : so , what i &apos;m really interested in is what i &apos;m going to call the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — how do you think about it ?
there are two kinds of ideas about wikipedia and julia .
one is the hero , <unk> <unk> .
the other is the <unk> .
who is ideas , who is it ?
how do you search for the dangers ?
ja : well , it &apos;s got to be a couple of guys .
ca : that was the people , it was the audience .
we have to work a little bit more . show another one .
and that &apos;s not the reason that i can &apos;t publish it , but i &apos;m not going to get it wrong .
is it a really interesting business about this ?
what is this ?
ja : this is one of the things we see every day .
the last one of the early days was the result in the gulf of mexico , and there was no matter of the power in the gulf of mexico .
so we &apos;ve been an engineer , and we actually have to get the money to get the parties to get to the party with the big masters of the big architects of the company .
there was a lot of the government of the government and the other people .
the engineer was no longer a relationship with them . it was a series of hard things .
we didn &apos;t know who was writing , and what it was .
we had a little bit less fruits and a little bit of a company that has a game company .
so , we have to think about it , we can answer the question , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re a little bit skeptical .
we don &apos;t know how to do it .
so , it &apos;s a good reason . it looks intuitive , but we don &apos;t know about it . &quot; &quot; and so , i said , &quot; &quot; well , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever done this before , and we &apos;ve got this email company , and we &apos;ve got this <unk> company . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) we were written , and we said , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to have the center of the principal . &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to say &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to be
you know what you think about the next year ?
what if you were to have the law of the script ?
do you really think ? &quot; &quot; and the answer is , &quot; &quot; the answer is , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re sending a photo by the mike <unk> <unk> .
it was like that .
( applause ) it &apos;s pretty much the news .
it &apos;s one of the methods that i &apos;ve been trying to do , and i think that is a place called <unk> .
ca : so , how did you have the universe ?
ja : yeah , it &apos;s very , very , very , very quickly , and they &apos;re also going to come from the players , and the engineers are getting out of their hands .
we &apos;ve spent the last couple of months taking a chance of making an important job of protecting our creative practices of the elderly .
it &apos;s a little problem .
the other ones that start out there are other things that we have , and we &apos;ve been able to get all the information that we &apos;re going to do , and even though we have a lot of information , we don &apos;t have a lot of choice to do it all the time .
ca : so , what is it that you need to tell you , what &apos;s going to be present in the real world ?
ja : yes . we &apos;re going to believe in .
it &apos;s hard to believe that there &apos;s a lot of information that we have to do with a few different ways , and we have to have people who can be able to cope with very high levels of silence .
ca : so , why is it that you start to work ?
i mean , you know , if you &apos;re a kid in the middle of the childhood , you &apos;re 37 degrees fahrenheit .
is it true ?
ja : my leaders have been in the business business , and i &apos;m going to escape the number of religions , the two of them .
( laughter ) ca : so , these are the ones who have been this <unk> <unk> .
ja : what do you hold the movie business ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) ca : you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s
ja : <unk> was just about .
i was one of young young people .
i was born in a young age when i was young .
there &apos;s a little bit of a behavior that we have .
it &apos;s possible to get different kinds of things .
well , contrary to the fact that many of the other people who have the russians , you know , are the ones that have the money in the bank account .
and it was not just a couple of years ago .
ca : well , i &apos;m not thinking about this , you know , who &apos;s the person who &apos;s going to get your money to work . what do you mean ?
can you give me a short story about them , or do you know what &apos;s going on from the bat or the other ?
ja : so i can &apos;t think about it .
but i mean , i think the main thing about it and the generosity and the generous people are not helping the victims ; the help of the victims .
and i &apos;ve learned that i have learned from the people who are generous in my life .
ca : it &apos;s hard : it doesn &apos;t work with the human body ; it &apos;s going to protect them ?
ja : i have a little bit of faith , i &apos;m going to protect them , and i &apos;m not going to show up , and i &apos;m not — i &apos;m going to protect the victims of people who are taking out seriously .
this is a character that i &apos;ve been in for a long time .
ca : so , what about what &apos;s going on in the last few minutes ?
there was a problem with the bank , because there &apos;s been a problem , and there was a lot of news news that i didn &apos;t know .
on the one hand , it was evil .
you &apos;ve made a good job . you know , what happened ?
ja : that &apos;s the big deal .
it was the country in the economy .
one of the largest countries in the world .
ten times more than the number of other sectors .
we published this information in the first place .
it was given to me about five minutes before the treatment of the tv show . ( laughter ) who &apos;s in the movies five years ago , the father came to five hours before the news came , and he didn &apos;t know what to do , &quot; how did it be ? &quot;
we published the news in tv . we talked about it in the name of islam , and we talked about it , and we told them about it .
every day in the community , they said , &quot; &quot; no , no one &apos;s ever going to get a mistake . &quot; &quot; so , as a result of a couple of swiss politicians , with <unk> <unk> , with the international partners , they have been a new case for the government of the government , and they say that , &quot; &quot; well , that &apos;s one of the most laws that we have in the world .
the name of islam has been involved in the system of other countries to get to the system .
and so this is what it was like to month when the law was so much like this .
ca : vodka .
( applause )
how do you believe in the future ? how do you believe that the big brother is going to be everything , and if people are going to lead to a great brother , what will happen ?
ja : how is it going to be ?
in all of the world — china and the u.s. and <unk> are everywhere in the world .
it &apos;s hard to see how the future will be .
it &apos;s a very interesting cycle , where we live in a very long way .
ca : so i feel like we &apos;re listening to what we &apos;re listening to , what julian thinks is , you have power .
ja : thank you , chris . ( ca : right . ) ( applause )
i &apos;m writing .
i want to tell you the story , and i &apos;m going to talk to you today about the art of writing , and i &apos;m going to talk to you about a little bit about what &apos;s called a <unk> .
but before i start those things , i &apos;m just briefly <unk> about the story .
i &apos;m going to make the words out of the words , and it &apos;s also the idea that you &apos;re going to get a few minutes out of the mountain .
i &apos;m born in the french state in france .
i &apos;ve come up with a little bit of my life , and i &apos;ve got all sorts of things .
i was growing up in the first place in the history of the ancient city .
in the 1970s , the constitution was very small .
most of the families in our families were parents who were born with a woman who had died , and i grew up in the world with the women .
i actually grew up in the media lab at two groups .
it was a war , a world of war , earth , europe — a woman .
on the other side , i had always felt like a younger woman , a little bit less <unk> , a little bit of a little bit of randomness .
my mother was coffee with a coffee mug , a little bit like a coffee movie , and it was different by the devil &apos;s body , and it was different than the devil .
they were able to travel over and over and over again .
and every time my wife went to school , she was able to take the girls &apos; face in the afternoon .
then they hit each other to the unit .
one week later , the patient came to the museum .
i know that it &apos;s so hard that i can see that there &apos;s a strange amount of raw information and human beings in the face of the human being , but i don &apos;t see any of the people that come to my wife , and i don &apos;t see anybody who &apos;s going to take the rest of my perspective .
i asked , &quot; how does it be the power of the shower ? &quot;
he said , &quot; &quot; yes , there &apos;s a lot of prayers of the prayers , but the main drivers are the power . &quot; &quot; and i learned from that , and i learned from there , there were lots of lessons , if you wanted to do something , if you wanted to do anything , you would need to be able to go back and forth .
it &apos;s embedded in the inside .
each of us is a <unk> and a circle of circles .
it &apos;s all of us .
we &apos;re born with a family , a ring , a symphony , and you &apos;re born .
but when we don &apos;t know about the world where we &apos;re going to be , if you don &apos;t know whether or not we can get any of them around the world , we &apos;re willing to connect with it .
we can reduce the power of the power . we have a lot of human suffering in the sense that we have a lot of human beings .
our friends , our neighbors , our brothers , our apartment , and as many of us , we were very , very close to our own self .
and as a turkey , women have been doing something like this , they &apos;ll be able to put on top of their intuition , or on top of the intuition — the opposite of the intuition .
it &apos;s a belief that the belief that is happening here is that it &apos;s not really good for a person to look at it .
and even though it &apos;s odd , it &apos;s one of the largest threats on our planet in the world .
and it &apos;s all over the place , and liberals and conservatives and conservatives and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
we have a group of groups and stories that are really familiar with , and we are <unk> about the other ones .
so , the idea of writing software is that it &apos;s basically a way to get the way back to the vaccine .
stories can be limited to a hole in our gut .
we can look at these holes , and we can see that we see both the world and see it .
i started writing stories from eight years old .
one day , my mother gave me an idea , and he said , &quot; &quot; well , i want to tell you my good story about how to write and write my stories .
now , i think it &apos;s a little bit scary when i think about it .
my home was home to my family with my family , but i didn &apos;t know how to tell those stories about their own friends .
i &apos;m going to talk to the honey circles , and i &apos;m going to talk about how i am , or a little boy on the side of me , and i believe it &apos;s a good idea that the idea is that i write a lot of good ideas .
but he didn &apos;t know that , i thought it was really boring to my life , and that &apos;s what i would like to do , and this was my mantra of my life .
i started writing about it , not just about that , but what i didn &apos;t like to write about it .
i started with my software for my journey to love .
first of all , writing about life is more than a <unk> , a lot of other people &apos;s stories .
so here &apos;s a little bit of : you know , let me take a look at the circle , and this is what these things are in my life .
and so on this circle , he gave it another .
my mother was a diplomat .
and i was in the same way , in the same way , in the same way that i was in the school , and i came up with the international school of mine , the international school of mine .
for the first time , i was struck by the challenge that i had to say , &quot; &quot; typical drug , &quot; &quot; which was a kid who was kids from children , and it was a very important thing to do with it .
in fact , in the sense , kids were involved in this notion that they had to be their own favorite , but not only their own favorite ones .
we were able to look at the united nations , and they were both fun , they would have been playful , and every chance to talk about it is whether it &apos;s a cat or a cat .
and it was always fascinating , and it was fascinating .
and i was doing that , because i was in a school , when i was in school , it was all around the world , and he was unable to kill the gun gun , so she &apos;d put a gun gun in the museum of music .
( laughter ) i had a dream of getting a lot more than ever before i went out to school .
first of all , i saw my research in the school and i understood it .
i didn &apos;t look at all the kids , i was asking , &quot; &quot; dna is &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; and they were asked for a few questions , and they were asked me for a few questions , and they asked me if i could start to take a few years old .
i &apos;ve learned three strategies associated with turkey , politics , smoking and bust .
after the spain , we went to germany and germany .
i thought that my imagination and imagination could only be the ability to travel to the future of the imagination , and that &apos;s all of us .
stories make me feel the unity of oneness , the <unk> and the <unk> of life .
i &apos;ve gone to my <unk> city , which i love in my 20s .
i lived with a very large and <unk> museum , and i wrote a novel of my novel .
in <unk> , i was there .
i &apos;d seen the three things that i saw when i was out of the building .
she had a old , old wheelchair , and he sold it for the man and the <unk> of life .
she was sitting on her head with a long side , and he was sitting in the <unk> <unk> in his eye .
i &apos;ve seen that the first time it comes from the system that you can get from hands on the device , and i think it &apos;s a scene that &apos;s coming back from the outside of my body , and it &apos;s a scene in the <unk> of this train called <unk> <unk> .
when we &apos;re faced with death and distribution of our deaths , we &apos;re also looking for the world as a matter of fact , although it &apos;s a few months old .
and i believed that my stories were also a little nuts .
i don &apos;t want to say that it &apos;s powerful , because it is a good thing to do with it . &quot; &quot; but when i read a better novel , we start to look at the people that we don &apos;t have in the dark side of the night , and we don &apos;t have good ideas about it , and we don &apos;t have good ideas about it .
after the rest of my life , i went to college with a little girl in the basement .
it &apos;s not just the geography of the geography of the geography of the language , but this time .
i started writing english .
the judge , i have no sense of what i &apos;m supposed to do , and i &apos;m going to ask you to say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not going to change my english , but i &apos;m going to change my tongue .
i love writing , i &apos;m writing , i &apos;m writing more about my writing , and i like to write english , i &apos;m like , you know , i &apos;m going to be writing , and i think i &apos;m going to do it .
i think i &apos;ve got any other kind of connection .
i &apos;ve learned about english after the millions of people in the world , and then i learned from english .
and then , after the language of the language , you can also find out , as i hear it .
coming out later , again , more and more , more people , better jobs , make them better , and we want to make it better . we have less and more differences between our language and language .
this difference is scary .
but if we want to be afraid of it , that might be a promise .
this is what i learned in boston , and it was a <unk> and a <unk> .
so what i did was , in the case of all the time i saw all the things that i had to watch out of the day , i would say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to marry my plea for the rest of the day , &quot; &quot; and i would say , &quot; &quot; oh , i want to go to the front of your daily senses . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and i could have a little <unk> somewhere on the front lines .
i did the family for dinner .
( laughter ) but then i went back to arizona .
and i began to come back to the syrian community who was living in the middle of israel , and i began to come out of the world in the other two different parts of the world .
if i &apos;m a part of my mind , i think of the physics and the soul .
it &apos;s always my ability to keep all my activities and pieces of me .
and i think of it as the idea that it &apos;s getting better when the story gets better than the story .
so i wanted to talk to you about this idea .
one of the artifacts i wrote in english was that it was a picture of a <unk> <unk> .
&quot; &quot; he came up to me . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a little bit old . &quot;
( laughter ) i asked my question .
he said , &quot; &quot; well , i think you can see that if you want to see , you know , there &apos;s a lot of heroic , <unk> , <unk> heroes , but there &apos;s a lot of them , and he has a lot to say , &quot; &quot; the fact is that it &apos;s a person in the boston campaign , but i &apos;m not sure what it &apos;s like to do , but i mean , it &apos;s normal .
but i also know that i &apos;m always going to take it away .
he wanted to be my own <unk> .
he wanted to be the whole woman in the book that i wanted to be a woman .
we can always talk about the change of the story , but we can see that politics can spread to the spread of politics , to read and start to deal with it .
most of the writing , i don &apos;t think that , especially the software , is that we have these <unk> .
if you &apos;re a woman who &apos;s more than the islamic world , they will show you what it &apos;s like to be women , and that &apos;s why women are better than happy .
more <unk> , more <unk> , sad markets , you observe that you &apos;re going to be far away from the elevator .
in the course of my childhood , i had a little bit of a bit of a conversation about the world &apos;s dilemma .
the writings are not the people who have ideas that are ideas that are not ideas , but they &apos;re aware of their own and their deaths as a few bucks , a couple of writers , a couple of writers .
they don &apos;t realize the difference between us and our civilization .
in the 1960s , in the summer of 2004 and the japanese james <unk> , he gave him a couple of <unk> to homosexuality .
he wrote the koran in a blue printer , and he said , &quot; &quot; you see , i &apos;ve got nothing else , you know , i &apos;ve never seen anything else , and i don &apos;t have any other ones that are in the world . &quot; &quot; and the politics is that we have a threat of freedom .
there is a tremendous capacity for all of the writing of all the writing , not a <unk> .
the first thing that happened about 10 years ago is that it was a good student at harvard .
we &apos;ve written three of them , a <unk> from a philosopher , looks a kind of a bit like a <unk> .
( laughter ) it was not the answer to whether or not it was going to come together .
our alone was our pants .
they &apos;re making music stories from other nations .
it &apos;s a family in india .
they &apos;re not alone in the writing , but the fact that they are the ones that are the more victims of the world .
i have to say that the rest of the world doesn &apos;t exist yet .
it &apos;s in the world .
i saw this in the first time when i saw the story of the hero in 2005 .
i worked , i &apos;ve been working with a lot of variation on the women and the family family and a new york city .
and when i went to court , my little story was surrounded by a great pandemic .
when i wrote a group about the vietnam war , they told me about some of the reasons why i was writing me .
but i just wanted to tell each of those two reasons , and it &apos;s just about literature .
it &apos;s just the story .
i want to reduce the value of what i call the &quot; &quot; just the story &quot; &quot; to say .
i mean , how do you think they can &apos;t be able to do it , how do we think they &apos;re doing it ?
the writings are famous for their perspective , but the political books are so remarkable , and today , the language of politics is not a political language .
the odds of this said , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about the way that it works and the way it is , and the way it is , the way it works .
and the second of the artist is the job . &quot; &quot; politics politics does us from us . it unites us .
one can help hope .
the other is different .
one is taken .
the other is known .
politics is been edited out .
literature on water .
in the chaos of the journal , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; is the story that they &apos;re wearing , they &apos;re going to be <unk> , they &apos;re telling us that stories will be very , very important .
they change their voices to express different objects in the story , and they have them .
he was able to listen to him , and he was called the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
stories are familiar with the middle east . the middle east , the africa , the balkans , the balkans and asia .
and stories can transcend space .
and when they &apos;re talking about political and israelis politicians , they actually listen to someone else &apos;s name , but they actually read his name , <unk> <unk> , who may be the best of his dream .
and the literature should make us longer .
but if it does that , it &apos;s not good .
books are — i have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit about how to make sense .
but books have the ability to fold up .
after the first time with the <unk> and the spirit of the <unk> , the city of the city of <unk> , the first one of the original things , was to destroy your soul .
and they say , &quot; &quot; well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re not aware of your life , you know , it &apos;s more than ignorance , it &apos;s more than a ignorance . &quot; &quot; and the fact that we call this today , we don &apos;t think we have a problem , and we know more about each other , we know we &apos;re going to be familiar with , we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> ,
there &apos;s an analogy that i love : the animal has the movement .
it &apos;s an inch of the composition .
the other thing is , everybody knows , it is always the process .
and i can tell you .
so , one of the things that i wrote , that i &apos;m writing about , is that i &apos;m afraid of all of you , and the other part is , it &apos;s the kind of thing that happens in the world .
i &apos;m really interested in my best place , and i &apos;m going to believe that it &apos;s everywhere , and it &apos;s everywhere .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you see the tone , the tone of the light , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
there &apos;s a place where there &apos;s a place called the landscape where the people are sitting in the room .
it &apos;s between the buildings .
and i love this approach .
it &apos;s what we call the <unk> .
we &apos;ve been able to make sure that we are surrounded by <unk> creatures , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and my idea is that there are places where there are no cars that are in the field .
i &apos;m trying to try and experience it , while i write .
i love to think about 10 years later .
i love my characters .
i &apos;m writing one of my novel books in the morning , and there &apos;s going to be a great possibility for the great possibility of professor of mine .
it &apos;s about everything that comes out of us .
it &apos;s like in the diner , &quot; &quot; our smart ancestors say , &quot; &quot; i think , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; i say , &quot; &quot; i feel , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not sure .
and i don &apos;t deal with it , because we &apos;ve just done it all over time , and we &apos;re writing about things that you can do .
maybe it &apos;s not too good for the start .
it &apos;s not about how we &apos;re creative , and what we know about how we are , and how we feel .
we need to learn to write about ideas and other things that we &apos;re looking for .
we need to get away from the genes , to other people .
the diving mountains , the <unk> <unk> .
not by the political condition , they &apos;re all the combination together , and that &apos;s the good news .
i &apos;d like to end up with the <unk> of the sufi , &quot; &quot; come in the way , be friendly , friendly , etc . , &quot; &quot; thank you .
( applause )
in my case , it &apos;s a small claim to be hidden in the hidden million galaxies .
it &apos;s my bed .
( laughter ) ( applause ) here &apos;s a woman who is a family here .
it &apos;s women .
so , i started to change the texture .
two years later , i did my <unk> .
i was at the stadium , and my milk was the <unk> , which was five pounds .
i started to understand this .
i &apos;ve been looking for the environment , and i &apos;ve met people , and i can tell him , as a matter of fact , the only way to be happier is to be happy , to be happy .
( applause ) so we &apos;re going to be women in the environment .
we &apos;re going to be the most likely to be the most familiar .
( laughter ) ( applause ) because it &apos;s very important for the people who are less likely to do it .
and i started to talk about one of these days , and i started to talk about what he was doing before the previous night .
and i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and i said , &quot; &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , i &apos;m not sure .
and it &apos;s about five hours a day , and it &apos;s more interesting to say , &quot; &quot; well , the more of the people are more likely to eat . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) many of them are less than the ones .
particularly in the case , in the case , if you want to invite a person to go to dinner , and you ask , &quot; &quot; 8 8 a.m. , &quot; &quot; you probably have a great chance to say , &quot; &quot; 8 : eight , but no one can play , but you can &apos;t see what it is . &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re thinking about it and it &apos;s not just that , because they &apos;re all right , and it &apos;s because you know , leaders , political politics , and trade leaders ,
right ?
not to be a good leader , but if it is not a good leader or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , you don &apos;t have to be a good leader .
the <unk> are the times the size of our titanic .
i think it was the lehman brothers , and i think that they were still in front of the big <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
( applause ) some of the women who had been 24 hours a day , had 24 hours or a half hours , and he would see what was going on , and maybe it would be why .
in a way that we &apos;ve met with these poor people , who are the benefit of the place where we live , who love the life that we &apos;re living in , and the <unk> , the <unk> , is the best of the world .
so , more importantly , you can &apos;t see your eyes , you know , to see the big claims in your gut , you can see the power of the dolphin .
thank you very much .
( applause )
my brother &apos;s brain disease , the foundation of my brother .
what is the problem ?
dr. francis was born with a baby .
&quot; &quot; normally people who have been accepted to be considered as normal as people are normal .
in my view , i learned that it was disease .
i was a kid , and i was a kid .
if you look at the brain , you can see that the brain is two sources of brain .
it &apos;s the same thing with the brain .
it &apos;s a parallel procedure , right now .
it &apos;s been done in both hemispheres .
if you think about things , they &apos;ll talk about things , and they can talk about different things .
let &apos;s donate it for me . thank you very much . thank you . ( laughter )
our right brain is defined by images of the body of our body .
energy is the way that we see the entire universe , the way we see the entire universe , all of the sudden , how much it looks like , what it looks like , what it feels like , how it &apos;s , how it feels , how it &apos;s .
we &apos;re the energy that &apos;s on the right of the right brain to transmit energy .
we &apos;re in this point , the perfect , full and <unk> .
the left brain is a completely different place .
the left-hand hemisphere is the idea .
and then you can see how it &apos;s going to make the best possible control of its way through the left-hand hemisphere .
and our left brain is thinking about gender .
we &apos;ve got our <unk> world with our external world .
this is a voice . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) ( applause ) ( applause )
and i don &apos;t think we need to know what &apos;s going on .
so i was in my business , and i started to get it .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; the golden rule . &quot; &quot; it was called <unk> — that was the golden rule .
i feel like i &apos;m moving slowly in my life .
and when i was standing in the shower , and i was standing in the shower , and when i was standing in the shower , i was standing in a shower .
i said , &quot; &quot; well , you know what ?
i don &apos;t know if you can see the atoms and the molecules on the wall .
the only thing i knew was that energy is the energy energy .
i said , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m all going to work everywhere .
i feel a lot in the body . i feel guilty .
you start with your eyes .
it was fine .
and then again , my left brain is back .
and i have my right arm .
my brain says , &quot; &quot; oh !
( laughter ) and then the crying comes up , and i said , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have a lot of words ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t always have the words . &quot; &quot; ( laughter )
i want to ask , &quot; &quot; i think , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; i think we &apos;re going to have a good job .
i &apos;m trying to make newspapers .
and i &apos;ve always been thinking about the number of people i &apos;ve ever seen .
so one of my favorite things was that i took my hand to my hand , and i took the hand to my hands on the phone .
instead , i think , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m <unk> from the lake .
what if i could save my lives and save lives ?
and my brain is one in two different parts .
how do you think that &apos;s great ?
and i &apos;m just going to have an interactive website .
it &apos;s going to move our right to our brain .
