And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be about to do about a million people who are active when they &apos;re active .
They &apos;ll get them to die .
And it &apos;s a terrible thought , but I think it &apos;s a real impact of the consequences that you see .
It was the first time I thought about it after a blog blog , a <unk> , a <unk> journalist , who died of cancer .
The guy asked her family and friends to write the mystery of a book that was published by him .
This is what he wrote .
He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s me . I &apos;m dead , and that &apos;s my last blog .
And I was asked , as I was going to get away from my body to cancer , my family and friends , to tell me that the idea that I could write the first part of my blog from the blog to my blog in the world . &quot; &quot; And the trick is , like , a few of those who are able to be able to write a lot better , and more innovative , but on the right , what I &apos;m all about to do today are the ones that are different from what they
See a little bit of paper .
You know , you can do some of the videos on youtube .
There are 200 million people on the board .
The average of the Facebook is the 90 percent of their body .
If you want to think about your parents and grandparents , the best they had made some of these pictures , or their videos and the video that you can see in a little hidden way .
But today , we have the latest bahamas in the world that are going to live in the clouds of a little while we &apos;re dying .
I think it &apos;s a wonderful thing about the ability to do this .
For a clear , I &apos;m a journalist , not a technology , because I want to say , I would like to draw a picture of the picture of what the future and future will be .
We &apos;ve already got some kind of service that allows us to be what we &apos;re going to do with our online and <unk> , when we &apos;re dying .
One day , they were very , very , very few years old , and I was going to visit the new York bus card .
( Recording ) Adam : welcome .
Death : Adam ?
Ca : Yeah .
Death : Death will prevent you anywhere in any room at any time .
And , who is it ?
Death : &quot; &quot; When I die &quot; &quot; &#93; I didn &apos;t get too late .
( Laughter ) Ca : that &apos;s terrible , right ?
This service service is very simple things that allow us to create the ideas or the video that can be published on Facebook after your death .
And another person that &apos;s called a 1,000 .
It allows you to go back to the left and to make this picture , and the stories and the stories they can tell after their death .
But it &apos;s just amazing .
Many of you probably would have heard of a lot of <unk> that have been affected by the suffering that he can &apos;t have to do more than 90,000 hours per second .
I think that the capacity of the power of a car is a human , and it &apos;s a huge amount of data that we can do with the data , and you can create the content of content on all of your lives — Twitter , graphics , videos , blog — that we &apos;re producing wealth .
And I think it &apos;s just possible that we may be able to live in the digital world , and we can still live in the middle of the world with the world that we have to do with the world that we &apos;re creating , and we can create technology to push it .
So we &apos;re looking at a couple of experiments .
There &apos;s a service that I &apos;m doing , and it &apos;s all about your data , and it &apos;s all about your data in your era , and everything you &apos;ve been doing , and it makes predictions .
So , as you can see , you can see the result of being a musician .
Imagine that something like that would be like five or 10 or 20 years to improve the technology .
And when you step back , the Medical lab has been working on robots that can interact with people .
And if robots could be able to interact with a specific character in a human , a hundred thousand thousands of content that people have created in life .
Finally , remember , before the scenes in the u.s. room in the United states , in the studio of CNN , they had the <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> by <unk> Cooper .
What if we could use this technology to project <unk> in our home , and interact with a really real place in a place where we live in the world ?
I think it &apos;s possible for us to have some of the things that we &apos;re going to do with information and technology , and it &apos;s increased by the same growth of the same growth rate .
And as a result , I think we all need to think better , or do we want to become a reality ? &quot; &quot; And when it &apos;s going to be a reality , and what &apos;s going on .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You know , you know , you know , you know , there are some amazing things that you can see .
The first one is from the age of <unk> .
Another one is from a group of scientists .
We actually think more about something we &apos;ve talked about .
And I &apos;m sorry to answer that .
There &apos;s a lot of resilience .
So what you &apos;re looking at is the next reality that you want to understand .
And then you can do it better .
What we need is that we need to get out of the underlying world of the world .
These systems are <unk> around the <unk> of fish , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The interesting thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to keep the math in math , and that &apos;s what it means that we &apos;re not using it .
What do we know about complex systems ?
And when it was , even though , when you call the behavior , we &apos;re going to get a good job .
And trying to understand the system that it &apos;s doing .
And that &apos;s what we do .
And it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not the object in the system .
And in a way , I &apos;m learning a system .
But why don &apos;t you ?
Where are the big nets ?
We &apos;re going to scan our <unk> nets .
<unk> <unk> may not be a child .
And the value of this is that it was about the most important thing to be about .
You may have seen a man who didn &apos;t look at the time .
&quot; How do they organize ? &quot; &quot; They say , &quot; &quot; Are they doing the same ?
Well , larry <unk> .
These are companies that work more than one country , and these are 43 .
In fact , he was working at the same time , and he was working together with 600 and <unk> .
It &apos;s about 75 percent of the participants .
And in terms of financial centers .
But they were all 95 percent of their own actions .
But what are the answers to who are the right ?
To do something like that .
So let &apos;s go back to the analysis .
This is the same thing that we have to do with him .
And these major <unk> .
They &apos;ve set up some few rules .
And it would be likely to be likely to have the world , the world pyramid .
So , I think , I think I want to talk about what it is , as we talk about love .
It &apos;s actually <unk> when we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to , but when I imagine this metaphor , I see the cartoon from the character — it &apos;s like a human being , it walks to the <unk> , and you can &apos;t see if it comes from the door to the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s like that , because it &apos;s not a <unk> .
It turns out that all of us are very different .
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our own .
I &apos;m a writer and a teacher &apos;s English language , which means , think , in terms of words , I &apos;m in my life .
I could say , and I &apos;d like to argue that a lot of the things that we &apos;re using to make a sense of love is perhaps even more of them — there &apos;s a problem .
So God , we fall .
We &apos;re beaten up .
We &apos;re growing .
We fall in a shelter .
We &apos;re coming out of the west .
Love will make us insane , and it makes us sick .
Our hearts are scared and then we go .
So our metals are <unk> in order to someone in an individual violence or disease .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s true .
And they end up with us as the <unk> and <unk> .
My favorite one of them is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; Which is the &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And when you look at this word in the dictionary — ( Laughter ) you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a terrible and terrible <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not saying that the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; Is very personal and <unk> .
Only in the book , only in the book , there &apos;s 16 years of words in the sentence &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; Button , &quot; &quot; In which it &apos;s used to be a <unk> God .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re using the words to tell you about the sin that explains the <unk> of <unk> . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So how did that happen ?
How do we get to the promise of love and love with a lot of pain ?
And why do we talk about this as a kind of good experience of how we are victims ?
It &apos;s hard for me , but I have some theories .
And to release it , I want to focus on one another <unk> metaphor that &apos;s crazy as crazy .
When I first began to learn a new love , I met this metaphor of crazy nuts everywhere .
The stories in the history of Western cultures are <unk> in a sense of <unk> of a disease disease .
Here &apos;s some examples .
He was like , &quot; &quot; Love &quot; &quot; Is &quot; &quot; Love &quot; &quot; Is just crazy , &quot; &quot; Love is always a crazy thing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Look at me , I &apos;m going to go , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Look , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that
It was the first time that I was going to work for 20 years , and it was enough to get away from the beginning .
It was a kind of relationship with the first one year , so it was very high , and it was very high .
And in particular , I remember one moment .
I was sitting on bed at a <unk> in Southern America , and I saw my love to go to the door .
It was very clear , it was almost filled with <unk> , and we went back to dinner , and when we went back to our room , he left his friends in a way and he got a little bit .
While I don &apos;t remember the tip of this , the <unk> , the very first , I remember it .
I was 22 , that was my first <unk> in the country that was developed and I was absolutely one .
I got a week to my home , and I knew the name of the mountain , where the name of the city , which I needed to do to go to the <unk> , but I didn &apos;t invent the way I could turn on the bed .
I didn &apos;t have a <unk> , and I didn &apos;t know if it was very much money , and I didn &apos;t know the british .
And some of the other things that I could have been able to grow up as a moment of opportunity , but I got stuck .
I was sitting there .
And then she was crying .
But even though I &apos;m a kid , a little voice voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was a drama .
I really love the left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) because some of the parts of my desire wanted me to feel confident .
Now , that sounds like this , but at 22 , I wanted to have dramatic experiences , and at that moment , I had a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s a strange thing , but I thought it would be a little bit of a little bit like a boy who was just going to leave me .
I think at a level , I was wanting to be a <unk> , because I thought it was love and working .
It really doesn &apos;t really have to be weird , getting out of attention , that there were eight movies , a songs of two , two songs , two or two , a name called &quot; &quot; Crazy crazy &quot; &quot; . And after repeat hours , he came back to our room .
We &apos;re stuck .
It &apos;s true . &quot; &quot; I thought that my first love will be like crazy .
But love to someone someone &apos;s — and like , what &apos;s the best thing that I &apos;m going to do with my life is that it &apos;s not a good thing to do with it .
But I think that kind of love is not very unusual .
Most of us feel that we have some kind of <unk> and early stages .
In fact , there &apos;s a research that says , &quot; &quot; What is it , &quot; &quot; So the neurons that show up , hannah and psychologists are not so easy to do .
It &apos;s true .
This is a study of 1999 that uses a lot of blood pressure to make sure that the average of the UK is very similar to the <unk> , in the middle of a diagnosis , by <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So , in the middle of the world , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the world , and the <unk> and the <unk> and depression .
So there are some evidence that the courage that binds to the direction of our next and the behavior .
And the other study of the study is that most of the other things that we want to do with it .
The researchers who are told that they &apos;ve been able to do the same in the bottom of the world , is that we have to think about what we &apos;re talking about about a novel , &quot; &quot; Love , &quot; &quot; That reminds me , as if someone was sitting in the computer .
And most of us feel the kind of thing that when it &apos;s finished .
They &apos;re going to be a few months later .
When I came back to my home trip , I was going to take a lot of time in my room , I &apos;m going to speak for a lot of time in my room , right ?
I decided that if my friends can &apos;t understand my own mountain mountain , I &apos;m sure I have a lot of them .
So I &apos;ve met a lot of them .
And that was probably the same thing that happened to me in my life .
But I think I felt that I was being relieved , because if I was a <unk> , then I would be able to show how I loved it .
And when I was able to show you , then , if we got to get it together .
It &apos;s a crazy idea , because it &apos;s not a universal rule that says , &quot; &quot; The great thing about this is that it &apos;s a great thing to do . &quot; &quot; But we talk about love , like it &apos;s true .
Our experience and love and biological , and cultural .
Our biology tells us that the sin is a good , active , round life in our brain , and it says that the sin of compassion is when you have a <unk> or a neuron , and it &apos;s a bit more complicated .
In fact , probably , you &apos;ve heard about this — it &apos;s like a neuron , and you can actually grow up a kind of <unk> .
( Laughter ) So our culture is using language to use and to take those ideas back .
And we can talk about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty interesting , a little bit of a different way .
Love is powerful for hours of pain , and we &apos;re going to say this in our words and the story , but we have our stories and our stories to prepare us to be very good and resilient .
What &apos;s interesting is that all of the things happen in culture , which is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like we want to be one of the crazy things that I think we love , and I think that &apos;s what we want to do .
It &apos;s horrible .
( Laughter ) In order to do that , we need to change our culture , and we want to change our expectations .
Imagine that we all were less likely to kiss love .
If we were more confident , more open to new innovations , more <unk> , and instead of going back to love , we would be in the <unk> .
I know that it takes a lot of money , but I &apos;m not the first person to make it .
The book is &quot; &quot; The headlights that we live in &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , and George <unk> , and what &apos;s interesting about this is that we have to change our metals .
They claim , and even more of all of the leaders of our future , like the prophecy of the future .
John , and <unk> <unk> a new metaphor for love : love , like , &quot; &quot; Love &quot; &quot; Art .
I &apos;m very excited about this kind of expression .
And the iranians are telling us that the headlights are used to grow up , that , in fact , there are ways that they all have to do with all the things that they are in the headlights .
And so , when you see , when you hear a lot of things like that , you know , what &apos;s going to work in the art of art is that you can &apos;t see it , you know , you know , the movies , the software , the business .
These ideas are good enough to take our cultural heritage into a long commercial sport , but they &apos;re also getting more and more different in the different ways — the temporary periods of accidents , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , because of the metals that make much greater progress on your experience .
So , if love is a real art of art , and it &apos;s love , it &apos;s a kind of experience .
Love is not a bad thing , eternal love and courage , and it takes care of our lives , of the <unk> , the <unk> and the voice of the <unk> .
And love is touching a mustache .
It &apos;s all about yourself , all the experience of love .
When I was young , I was never thought that I couldn &apos;t just make the whole sense .
When four years ago , the last time I met was — if the last day , gabby had ever been met — or when the international anniversary of julie julie could not be a <unk> , which she had before met four days ago .
Where is it ?
She wants to be sad .
Right ?
And as a result of this , the data , the theory , of course , is a third of them , not a place .
He &apos;s his father , he was his hands , he was walking out of the mountain .
I know that it &apos;s likely to have a <unk> century in contemporary african America , but when I was in the first tree , that &apos;s the same thing , but in 14 years later , the <unk> had a meaning for me .
To reimagine a sense of something that I &apos;m doing , which is something that I &apos;m excited about , not that what it &apos;s like to do with me and my job is , you know , it &apos;s a powerful power .
But it &apos;s still hard .
♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ oh , oh , ♫ ♫ oh , oh , ♫ ♫ oh , oh , ♫ ♫ oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , I think I &apos;m happy . &quot; &quot; And I feel like I &apos;m happy . I have to remind myself : my challenge in this relationship is to talk to my partner with what I want to do together .
It &apos;s also not easy .
But it &apos;s much better than the other thing that you &apos;re talking about , which is a crazy thing .
It &apos;s not a matter of love , and it &apos;s often overlooked .
Instead , we need to take a partner with a partner with a <unk> , if you can get it to be difficult , it sounds very simple , but it &apos;s a very useful momentum .
Because you have to stop thinking about yourself and your experience or your passion or your relationships , and start thinking about what you can do .
And this is a version of love to allow us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good . It &apos;s not possible for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; These relationships were the same than the plan , but it was great . &quot; &quot; The whole art of art is good , that it doesn &apos;t make any of you yourself .
So , the version of love is allowing us to decide what it looks like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And in fact , in fact , there was a new college student with a friend of mine , and I had a friend of mine , and he was in a car with <unk> , which is in the island of <unk> , which is in <unk> .
You know how it goes , if you &apos;re young , and I &apos;m not a woman — we didn &apos;t move the magic , they &apos;re mostly in the national parks , national wildlife , and the truth is that they &apos;re very long .
Somewhere in North Dakota — I turned to a friend and asked me what was going to happen for about miles away .
&quot; What is the character that &apos;s in the face of a woman ? &quot;
Her eyes had been cured .
And the teacher is sitting on the first place , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
( Laughter ) So , I said , &quot; &quot; You know , the ones that are familiar with the fact that you can see Chinese characters . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m looking at a little bit of time , and then I get a little bit of time and I get a little bit of fun , and I realize that I could see that I can &apos;t see if it &apos;s going to happen .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
( Laughter ) This is the famous character of the character for <unk> . ( Laughter )
In the last five years , I &apos;ve learned a lot about what I think about this , which is why we &apos;re losing the wrong sign of the dung , and how we are acting by when we think about the human mind .
I think this is a different way I think about the last five years .
My career career is going to be <unk> , but in the big time , there &apos;s no competition in the world .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of all of us will be willing to talk about what &apos;s going on with it , and yet we don &apos;t think about it .
Abstract technology .
We realize that every time in every room in this room is wrong .
We are people , we were wrong . We got it .
But when I go to the right side of my mind , I can see that this time , I can turn on this data , suddenly , all of the abstract things that you &apos;re looking at , and you can &apos;t imagine what I &apos;m going to do .
What &apos;s interesting is that we &apos;re living in the world today .
They &apos;re working on these things , they have to go to the <unk> , they have to come up with their voice .
In Education , it turns out that we &apos;re all <unk> in the world of cocaine , that we are always right .
That &apos;s me .
On my own , it &apos;s a problem , like every single one of us , on a personal or personal level , and all of us together together as a society .
What I want to tell you today is the first thing that we call it , because we can hear the right thing .
Secondly , it &apos;s why this approach is a problem .
And then I &apos;d like to translate you to what I want to walk on a sock clip , and if you can do it , it &apos;s the best thing you can do with <unk> , the mind and the creativity that you can do .
Why do we go back to the audience ?
One <unk> touches a little bit of it .
Let &apos;s ask you , if you &apos;re here , you &apos;re walking around , who are the ones you &apos;re wrong ?
Jealousy . Ignorance .
It &apos;s worth it . Good , cool .
The clarity of the <unk> , which is the embarrassment of it — thank you , all of them are cool .
You answer the question : &quot; &quot; What kind of experience you can &apos;t do with your mind . &quot;
( Laughter ) And the reason that my mother makes a mistake is to make sense of what it said , and then a whole bunch of <unk> , not ?
For example , you might be a mental feeling , or you feel a sense of a connection , and if you feel like that , you know , if you &apos;re not Chinese Chinese characters .
But the fact is that there &apos;s not a lot of emotion .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
Remember , <unk> , <unk> , where <unk> <unk> , but not <unk> ?
It &apos;s almost every single thing that &apos;s going on in this segment of this gray , and that is that we can see the same thing that we &apos;re looking at , and then you see the <unk> and the <unk> .
But every time you get the rocks of the rocks at the same time .
And it &apos;s funny , especially when you &apos;re six years , so what &apos;s happening to this is a <unk> .
He just keeps running running until he &apos;s looking at the press and don &apos;t know what to do with the three .
Here &apos;s the thing that happens .
When we do something wrong , not when it comes out of it , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s the kind of thing that I &apos;m going to do , and I &apos;m going to get a rock here .
You know , we &apos;re already wrong , and we &apos;re already aware of this , but we still feel confident about the ground .
I have to be able to stop what I was trying to do .
There &apos;s a sense of what &apos;s going on .
( Laughter ) Because of what we &apos;ve learned about this , what we &apos;ve learned is that we have the <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
We &apos;re not going to do a lot of things , but we don &apos;t have a <unk> mechanism , if we &apos;re wrong , don &apos;t fill it .
There &apos;s another reason why we go back to that point , and it &apos;s more than a culture of culture .
Imagine having a high school .
You &apos;re sitting on a seat , and a teacher gets a control . One of them looks like this .
In fact , it &apos;s not my own .
( Laughter ) Here you are in your school , and you &apos;re really sure what &apos;s going to happen when you think of yourself when I was a student .
It &apos;s a bad thing , and it &apos;s not happy .
So , in fact , there &apos;s also another <unk> , you know that , first of all , the ones who are wrong with the video , the <unk> , the <unk> process , and the second is to achieve success in life , that never had to be wrong .
We &apos;re going to study these wonderful lessons very well .
Most of us , and as I think , in this case , I think it &apos;s a little bit more <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Or not , the CEO of the CEO of finance in finance , he &apos;s an example of it , but is the super <unk> ?
( Laughter ) As you can see , you &apos;re all of the CEO , and you &apos;re all the CEO , you know .
High school .
It &apos;s just as if we &apos;re trapped , we may have something wrong .
Because , when we think about this , when we make mistakes , we &apos;re making something that &apos;s wrong with us .
So we insist on our own , because we feel intelligent , smart , nobler and Defense .
Let me tell you about a chance .
A few years ago , the name of <unk> <unk> is a woman called <unk> <unk> .
This hospital is in Boston .
And in this case , they had an academic college student with Harvard , he &apos;s one of the best ones in the country .
This woman came together to bring together a project .
And they put it under the drug , the surgeon on the back , and his mother , her mother , his mother , his mother &apos;s office .
<unk> , it was going to work .
And the woman wakes up , looking like yourself and says , &quot; &quot; Why am I not just done for a <unk> ? &quot; &quot; But <unk> on it , because the surgeon has done a hard thing on her foot , not on the right .
When it comes to the hospital hospital in the workplace , he said something very interesting .
&quot; &quot; In a few years of the surgeon , he had a sense that he was working on the right cut . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) why I &apos;m telling you this , because I believe that you can believe that you &apos;re going to believe that you &apos;re going to be on a simple <unk> , maybe it &apos;s very dangerous .
This is a kind of personalized speech that we all spend time hours of time and nelson to get , as a musical accident of what &apos;s actually happening in the old world .
And when we &apos;re in our behavior , we &apos;re going to take it up , and even though we don &apos;t think about the possibility of our mistakes , we &apos;re making it <unk> , and we &apos;re making it <unk> , and we &apos;re going to get a <unk> , and we have a radical economy .
It &apos;s a gigantic challenge for practice .
But this is another giant problem for society .
Think about it for a minute , what does it mean by the right .
It means that your faith is listening to the reality .
And in a sense , the challenge of the most important thing is that everyone &apos;s concerned about it .
And what I found out is that most of us explaining the people of other people who are using these very little <unk> , they &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
The first thing that we think is if somebody with a sense of consciousness is that they don &apos;t understand the data in the data .
They have no access to the information that you have , and if you &apos;re able to get this information with them to share with them , they &apos;ll be able to get them , and they <unk> your camp .
If it &apos;s not going to happen if we learn that it &apos;s the same thing that we have , but we still continue to do it , and we move on the other side , and we move to the other side of the world — that &apos;s what they are .
( Laughter ) Now , they all need a piece of paper , and they &apos;re <unk> , they can &apos;t get it together .
And if it doesn &apos;t work if we realize that people are wrong with us , they have to be the same facts and they &apos;re pretty good , and we &apos;re going to go to the third one , and they know what it is , but for their own purpose , we have to do that that &apos;s true .
It &apos;s a disaster .
This is what I want to keep out in front of us , and we &apos;re not allowed to prevent the mistakes , especially when it is necessary and we have to be bad for each other .
What I have to do with my life is that I think it &apos;s tragic , that the status quo is something that &apos;s going to happen to our human .
It &apos;s like , we want to believe that our minds are the most exciting people that we can see , and we can see the light of the light .
And we want to watch all the light from light around the world , and you can see exactly what &apos;s happening .
It &apos;s not the <unk> , and if it was , it would be the perfect place .
The magic of our minds is not that we can see the light that exists .
And that &apos;s what we can see light from not like this .
We can remember Memories of the future , thinking about the future , and we can imagine that we are other people in other places .
And that &apos;s because every time you can see a disorder , we can look at the end of the sky , and you can see it , and that &apos;s the way .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re wrong .
In order to 1,200 dollars , as long as he said , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s going to happen , &quot; &quot; I hope to be a woman , <unk> from the <unk> of the word &quot; &quot; <unk> ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong , I mean .
And the conclusion that the notion of our ability is wrong , it &apos;s not an awkward speech , it &apos;s something that you can &apos;t do before it &apos;s going to kill .
It &apos;s the human .
Because we &apos;re not God , we don &apos;t really know what this world is doing .
In contrast to other animals , we &apos;re trying to understand that light .
I think that this is a contradiction that we &apos;re taking , and that &apos;s the same , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re creating .
So , for the reasons , I started listening to a lot of the apollo program , which is the American life .
Listening to me , listen , and I started to feel that all of my sermons were about the wrong thing .
First of all , I thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
And I &apos;m always like a crazy thing to do .
She seems to be everywhere . &quot; &quot; This is the story .
But after a week , I had the opportunity to take the opportunity to attack the international prison program , and they had the same time .
I &apos;ve been able to share this with him , and he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s really . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Hey , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Hey , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be like , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s going to happen to you , and actually actually happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What is interesting , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; So what we need is information .
We need these moments of failure to make it happen , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do to get these things out . &quot; &quot; What else we do is the rest of the world , the audience , listen , the stories , are the ones that I want to tell you .
We &apos;re going to kind of like the scenes , the <unk> and the <unk> .
And what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re not going to do that .
But you know what we &apos;ve learned from this , because our lives are .
We think it &apos;s going to be true .
George Bush thought that the attack of the <unk> is going to release people , and they can bring people back into a democracy .
And it really happened .
And meanwhile , Mubarak tried to think that he would be a fan of the way of his life as though they don &apos;t count and <unk> , and then he can &apos;t help her son .
And it really happened .
You may have thought that <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to go back to school , and I &apos;m going to go back to my hometown , and my family rings .
And it really happened .
I have to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to write a little book book , something that I don &apos;t have to do , for some of you who can &apos;t be able to read .
And it really happened .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like life .
We &apos;ve been obsessed with ideas about what the world is , and we have to do that , and the best action is that we don &apos;t .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , but it &apos;s a place where we can &apos;t be able to be able to be wrong .
We &apos;re going to dedicate a week to innovation about the innovation , improve the way we go , but you know why we need to do these innovations , improve the way we go ?
Because it was a crazy thing that was crazy , and they had the potential to change the world — look at TED in 1998 , which is the same thing .
( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t it work or not ? ( Laughter )
Where did I have been trained , rats ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And again , we &apos;ve gone .
And that &apos;s what it does .
We invent a second idea .
We tell the other story .
We &apos;re on the same time .
Now , what &apos;s happening today , as you &apos;ve heard about seven million times , is how innovative it is .
Now , if you really want to invent innovation , then we &apos;re going to go outside of this tiny and <unk> space of this right and look at one of them , and you look at the other , and you look at nepal and the forest and the puzzle of the universe and let me say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Everyone &apos;s shared . ( Applause )
Five years of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the hotel to Manhattan and kill the <unk> , the leader of protecting protect .
In first cases , they didn &apos;t even know what they were concerned with , but the following results of the crime , and his <unk> began to fight the attack on the <unk> of new York , including <unk> , <unk> , headquarters and <unk> organization .
Thankfully , these plans have come off by the FBI .
But in fact , it explodes in 1993 in the world of gandhi &apos;s national gandhi , not to do anything else .
The result of the <unk> was in the <unk> .
El <unk> is my parents .
I was born in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the middle of the country , the new Yorker , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the parents who were working together , to help my kids learn better .
But when I got seven years old , the family in our family began to change .
My parents showed me that side of the country that I could find who is very confident , including most muslim .
My experience is that when people get one of them , they have a lot of time to understand what we all want to do .
In every single religion , in all of the people who are able to find some smart work of people who have a kind of <unk> experience that they have to do with their confidence that they need to be able to do anything about their own lives .
In a few months , the parents of the father who came up to me and told me that some of the last few friends , he had a friend , and I was told for a few months ago .
He said that the next morning , I &apos;m going to go to them .
We &apos;re going to get <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of the FBI .
The last day , my last Recording was put into a little <unk> <unk> in the middle of the city , and I was so excited to be , and in my mind , I &apos;m looking at the <unk> .
My grandfather turned to his friends and said to the arab world : &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; Which parents , that boy and his son .
They &apos;re very good at all of this , but only a few years later , I &apos;ve found that meaning .
They saw the idea that the parents who were my father .
The result of those people who convicted convicted in the van who had been heated by <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> North atlantic in the middle of the world , and it was growing up for the last year , and it was more than a thousand times .
It was men , and I was thinking .
These are the people I &apos;ve called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; .
I changed the place of the past 20 years , and this is an extension of my family to get away with my own opportunity .
Every time I want to experience myself in a room , I was going to get the time and try to move the other side .
The future is always going to be new in the class , and I was part of the <unk> .
I found out a lot more deeply than that , but it turns out to be able to stop looking for a kid in the middle of the class .
And I was walking into computer games .
The <unk> that my social skills were , they say , they &apos;re not happy . They &apos;re not better .
I was learning about judgment of people in terms of the circumstances of the circumstances , like religion or race .
What did my eyes find ?
The first time that we were able to take this image of mind was that , at the same time , the president of the year 2000 .
In a way of training , I was able to go back to the East of the nazi national university in Philadelphia .
Now , my father was nine young women , who had been killed by the violence .
The members of our group are the most different plastic crop .
One day , the younger man , I was able to find out that one of my new friends was Jewish .
Because it was a few days ago , a little bit of a <unk> , a <unk> .
I had never had a friend of friends , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so proud , &quot; &quot; And I was so proud to cross the bar , and I had a <unk> counter that I believe in almost everything else .
In a tipping point , there was a year in the &apos; 50s and a half years ago . It was the <unk> .
I &apos;ve seen the most different beliefs about culture and culture , and this experience is truly fundamental to become individual personalities .
That &apos;s not fair to do that .
As a result , I had the opportunity and I quickly found out that many of them were the best and the best ones .
Part of the closet , in the checklisted childhood , is the idea of being treated with others , and for me , I want to bet for others good people , not as I want to do with me .
It seems to allow me to connect me to the stereotypes that I &apos;ve learned in the childhood and the lives of the experience .
I &apos;m a little bit like this , to be <unk> .
And then there &apos;s the Daily track . Every night , John John <unk> <unk> me to be honest with me that my personal fans and my help me understand , race , religion , sexual sexuality doesn &apos;t have to do nothing with the attributes of character .
Many of them are suffering from my parents , and I had a lot of time .
And when you get a piece of inspiration from where you &apos;re going to go away from the rest of the world , you can understand that <unk> <unk> in my light as much as a young woman .
One day I was talking to my mother about how I was going to turn my head , and she said to me something that I would hold on your heart .
She looked at me in the eyes of the eyes of some of the eyes of a lot more <unk> , and she said , &quot; &quot; I hate people .
And at this point , I realized that the amount of negative energy needs to make a difference in this country , to make sure that you &apos;re going to get yourself to yourself .
Zack <unk> is not my true name .
I &apos;m going to bring him back to my family with my parents and I began to live in my life .
So why do I discover my own potential and potentially potentially be really dangerous ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
I &apos;m doing this in a skirt that I hear somebody &apos;s hearing is a little bit more and more important than the violence .
Instead of using this experience , I use my experience to help you help with your own experience .
I do it for a while , and for them , for pain , for the pain , the suffering , the suffering , the suffering that they were suffering from .
So with memory , if I want to talk to you , I think , I think , if I want to do that , I think I want to try and try to do that without judgment .
I &apos;m still here to prove that violence is not the most private part of religion or race , and that the son is not tied to their parents &apos; father .
I &apos;m not my parents .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Or it might be about a kid or a child , or maybe a child or a child , and it &apos;s a little bit of a child .
And one of them is not the best thing .
You can help to make a bigger choice than less .
When I got the university , I was a woman , and I found myself a little bit more .
Where my idea is that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in my school , where I think it &apos;s a little bit of a new York city .
The truth was in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle East .
It &apos;s hard , it &apos;s hard .
So , you know , listening to the hard thing .
It can &apos;t be .
When the solutions are good , it seems to be the same idea .
It &apos;s a time on the family .
Maybe some of the things that you can do , you can &apos;t tell you .
We &apos;re going to be able to invest .
If you don &apos;t have an <unk> , you know , if you were <unk> , you don &apos;t know how to do it .
And you &apos;ve made some reason for ourselves .
What happens is , we do something wrong .
I love who loves chocolate chocolate .
If we are the ones that we care for ourselves .
You become an individual .
A few years ago , then I decided to take a journey of paths , a huge American American , <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> student in this process .
Instead of a <unk> , a few years later , she was more likely to smell .
This picture I had to do when I did this photograph every day .
I didn &apos;t have to be <unk> .
And I also learned that .
In fact , the sacred world is not going to sleep .
But <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s frightening .
I don &apos;t have a parent to say , &quot; I &apos;m a specialist with information technology . &quot;
Not if I &apos;m happy , I can say , &quot; I &apos;m an eye specialist . &quot;
I realized that when I was going to take a little bit , the change was changed , they would be in my Daily activities .
In fact , they &apos;re <unk> .
( Applause )
I &apos;m very privileged to get a kid in the country , think about the best places in the world to be women .
In 1975 , when I was a year , women were in the middle of a single woman .
That day , they didn &apos;t work , they didn &apos;t have a job , or they needed jobs .
They went to the middle of a <unk> center — a member of 90 percent of the women — and <unk> , in the state of office , to do whatever .
Nothing didn &apos;t work in the middle of the day , because nothing doesn &apos;t work if women don &apos;t .
( Applause ) In five years , the family had to marry the first country of the world in the world , which is the british <unk> of women who were women in the form of president .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , as the president of the <unk> , of course , we had a name in my head , and he came out on the house of his house , a <unk> <unk> , and a friend of mine .
( Applause ) Now , it became incredible patterns to translate to me for every single person who was growing up at the time , including the cotton of the cotton .
It was part of a story about a <unk> , which came to him with a few of the people that I want to say , &quot; &quot; And can the power be to be the presidents when they grow ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) and modeling the model really matter , but even though they &apos;re strong , and even though they &apos;re very strong , and I think that the question is , &quot; &quot; Who am I to carry on this bridge ?
Who am I to be the president ? &quot; &quot; And the result is that women are less prone to <unk> .
The survey in the United states in 2011 , by 2050 , that 62 percent of the men looked at the candidate to the president , but only 45 percent of women .
We saw this 16 percent , and that was the fact that decades ago .
It &apos;s true , because I believe that the world needs to be a leader and a leader of the leader of the leader .
Because my decision , the idea of the balance of all the things that I felt about to make sure that we should be able to do something like it , even without any political experience , I &apos;m going to go back and try to take the light that we have to do with the kids that we need to do with the kids that we need to do with the kids that we need to do with them , and girls who achieve the rest of their lives .
It was the journey of my life .
It was wonderful .
I was going to end up with 20 extra porridge .
After a taxi , there was a three times in the nine days , and finally , the race came up with four and three men and me .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not the drama .
Perhaps , you think that there &apos;s a lot of drama here , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that we &apos;re in the middle of the box .
First of all , the president , the first 20 years , is that it doesn &apos;t take the balance , it &apos;s probably perhaps , and it &apos;s led to the number of candidates .
And then , when he <unk> , if our <unk> <unk> fall in a sense of Panama Panama documents , he was suffering with his family .
The United states came up with the most important part , because the president of the police need a leader .
And a few days ago , with his wife and his family and her family , she had a young child in the middle of his head , and he went back to the race .
And before I got him , he explained what he does , because now there are two skilled men who can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
So , nine days later on , on the right , looked at the right side , and I &apos;m not going to look at it .
I didn &apos;t even have a place in the newspaper .
And I thought , well , I was one percent , but it was the middle of the middle of all the <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to be able to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have a chance to get my career to go and get a place to go on a phone , because the telephone has decided to turn on to be <unk> by the <unk> of two and two percent of the voices of interviewed .
The next day , these arguments found that I would have been involved with all the men , and as a result , I found that I was getting up to two and a half percent .
( Applause ) And the problem is .
The major problems that have been able to deal with and figure out how to do this , they were connected to medicine , supported and affordable .
I &apos;m going to start with medicine .
Some claim that gender is a matter of medicine and politics .
I can &apos;t cooperate .
I was getting more money to access , and I think it &apos;s more important .
And I was told that , in my 20s , I had a few months later , and I had a few months later , and I had a few months before I was there .
And I don &apos;t know what medicine is doing .
I &apos;m going to say that the reason it &apos;s not important to work in the media , especially in the media , as much as the <unk> , is that it is the most important and unconscious of the first time that we want to change .
When I was able to get access to the treatment , the first question I thought was , &quot; Do you plan to get your jewelry ? &quot; &quot; It was a hard time .
And , of course , with one of the two and two percent of the voice from him .
But the media really matter , and every time I got it , we saw , we looked at it , and we looked at it , and I don &apos;t know what I think is important , and why we need to pretend to do that .
I had a couple of four candidates for me to do not on the first place .
And I was waiting for hours to try to avoid the other things that would remain , and beyond that .
I was confronted with this , but I &apos;m going to tell the british <unk> .
There was nothing like that , and I had a lot of comments on my hair .
( Applause ) High school is worth it .
But there &apos;s another very important experience .
I was like a independent diplomat , without a political or a political party .
And it &apos;s very small , and it &apos;s available to the resources and the access to the resources and perhaps the <unk> of the company , but also allows them to be able to do this differently .
Our company was positive , and so we could change the tone of others .
And in the case , the number of times the number of times , for example , is that I wanted to show the other things that we can do .
When it has access to a systematic , we &apos;ve just learned how much information we do .
I &apos;ve been online online , and I was online , and I was asking for a few years .
And all of the sudden , all of these things that I &apos;ve been trying to do with the answer was that we were able to turn on Facebook , and we believed in importance to the first time you want to draw .
When it turned out to be a problem with attention and a lot of fun , I was starting to use math .
Young people showed me how to do that , and I used all of these movies to be tested by <unk> at the last few companies .
I really needed a lot of people in the room , because I &apos;m a professor .
But thanks to that , we &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> to the younger people .
It &apos;s the same as possible for companies and companies .
Unfortunately , nelson mandela was telling you about not a lot of money .
I mean , the truth is that it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s true , and we &apos;ve had less resources and more resources .
Perhaps , the reason is that I was part of it , and it &apos;s been difficult to do with financial support .
And perhaps , I wanted to make more of the smaller ones .
Some of them say it &apos;s very <unk> .
But even in the middle of the media , the funding looks like it , but it &apos;s a wonderful team , but it &apos;s a wonderful team , and we got it all of the time that we had the numbers .
I was surprised myself as you can see .
( Laughter ) By the first data , I was walking up with <unk> .
( Beeps ) Now , I don &apos;t have to be <unk> , because I didn &apos;t have a chance to do it , but I took a different point , and we went through the bottom of the number of voices , and we took a long way to get a voice , and we took a long way out of the world .
Because this is the name of my mind that I &apos;m going to win the choices , and many of whom have changed my life again .
But in fact , I &apos;m trying to motivate me to say , &quot; &quot; I am more likely to be more likely to support more than the younger people on my head , and the great number of people raised my daughter &apos;s daughter in the year 2040 .
( Applause ) It &apos;s 13 , and it never happened .
But in the next day , I was able to see it , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I was sorry , but she was honest .
Perhaps , it was the <unk> of my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
In a prison , a little girl , a little kid , when I was able to see that she had been on a bus memorial , and I decided that he had to stop him .
Audience : Oh !
This picture was for me .
We can achieve all the things that you see .
It &apos;s the fear of fear and the problem .
( Applause ) Women and women need , and the time of women , they &apos;re going to balance , they &apos;re going to be the CEO of the president .
I &apos;ve also been asked for the new Yorker magazine , &quot; &quot; The new Yorker . &quot; &quot; And I got new ideas to say , &quot; &quot; The real little score is prime . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) now , you know , that &apos;s what I &apos;m saying , and that &apos;s why I was so happy to say , because the women are so low , because the women are so low , because they &apos;re not allowed to have a lot of intellectual talent as I had a name , but I knew from
( Applause ) And we need to use more .
The day of choice , we &apos;ve become sacred , because we felt like that .
It &apos;s not enough to do it .
I &apos;m just going to go to you , and you &apos;re your family and friends , all the way that you can work with you , if you &apos;re good , you &apos;re getting better , and you know how to remember .
We &apos;ve got an hour , and I was a <unk> , and I was so much about what I can tell you about today .
But I bet I was really hard .
I don &apos;t have a lot of slept .
And it took a lot of anxiety and perseverance so that I didn &apos;t know , and I was starting to know that I had another thought that I had another day , and you could only find the same thing that I thought I could do with my best voice , and you &apos;re really angry with your own voice .
As speaking of my sister sister , you can actually start with your instinct , but we haven &apos;t been there .
I want to be sorry , and you all know , you know , your current journey is a team .
People who ate the value of your values and seeing it , but differences in others .
For me , this is the success of the success , I &apos;m a <unk> of a wonderful thing that I &apos;m here today — ( Applause ) — and I &apos;m really excited about it , and we got to know as an individual , and you know what it &apos;s like .
And I thought , if a woman was supposed to do with the audience , I thought , &quot; &quot; What would I be going to do when I get seven percent . &quot;
I would measure it a lot more , because maybe it &apos;s absolutely true , and it was being shot in my mind in the <unk> .
But on the next day , I decided to say that he was wrong .
It &apos;s really important to read this , because I really really slept and worked hard , like people with me .
We &apos;re never able to achieve a lot if we forget about ourselves .
And I think it &apos;s very important two things : the people of people who are willing to share with you , but not as much as if it &apos;s more than having a friend &apos;s talking to people who are killing their energy , including the brilliant <unk> and the <unk> .
And I had all the support of others , and I was trying to trust some of the shots , because I had a lot of power to do with my power to go to the rest of the time .
If I was able to be able to be able to read the rest of the time , and it &apos;s time for the time , and it was a very important time — and I thought , I thought , &quot; &quot; My mind , &quot; &quot; And I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m asking for the question of why I am .
I call it a <unk> company , which is the essence of Islam in the world .
The first of them is &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to balance , and I &apos;m going to be making a good thing , and I wanted to be a leader of the organization as an institution for our own work during the <unk> company .
The other word is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; Or compassion .
I decided to ask for that journey .
You could take a lot of them , but you &apos;ve got a lot of money .
And I was doing all the time to inspire people .
The third word is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was open for all of you .
I didn &apos;t have a secret to all of Facebook and on our websites .
I think it &apos;s the first person you want to choose , and you &apos;re asking for answers .
And the more important words of the direction that you don &apos;t have to tell is that we &apos;re a <unk> computer game — women &apos;s power .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;m pretty happy that I was going to find the courage to balance it , but to make it a little bit better , but I &apos;ll get a lot of money .
I can &apos;t say that it was simple , but I &apos;m confident , and I think this whole team of galapagos , it was worth .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not going to leave you . ♫ <unk> <unk> : who are good hearing . PM : I can &apos;t shake you , not just a little bit .
What perhaps , in fact , all the way into this room is that it can be in front of you .
We &apos;re not going to get a voice to it , but there &apos;s something that we can take from the yemen , and that &apos;s the inspiration .
I mean , you know , enough of the old , remembering memory of 1975 , when women were coming out of the street , and that really became a huge fact that we have to do this .
You &apos;ve been sent to this person . ( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a picture , to remind us how it looked like the Earth , and that was in the process .
And you can see , because American media didn &apos;t send the message about this , but in the whole page of the city , women were coming back to the street . Right ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) PM : so can we tell the story about this ?
<unk> : 41 years from the fun of this , we can think of the best places in the world to be women , but our job is to come .
So , in a painting for eight , women , women in the end of the end , they were going to get a job , because that time , they &apos;ve got the results of the lhc .
( Applause ) So , the good thing was that young women and cotton did a lot more than they did , because he had an hour of <unk> <unk> .
PM : I &apos;m not going to make a difference to her future future plans , but I &apos;ll tell you that there &apos;s a great <unk> , if you &apos;re going to do it again .
Thank you , sue .
( Applause ) Thank you .

And I was trying to think about my career career as I am called <unk> , and the best example that I &apos;m doing is a new Yorker magazine for a couple years ago .
A little boy , looking at parents who said to me , &quot; &quot; Dad , when I &apos;m a girl , I want to be a president of mine . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I was a big fan , as a president was because I had access to some of the people in the world have ever been to meet people from the world .
I &apos;m not just 50 percent in America , but we &apos;ve got my wife to send more than the rest of the world .
We don &apos;t just meet with the koran or the president , but also , we also have a community of community who lived in the most distant neighborhoods .
It &apos;s about the human rights , and knowing the light as I know it , I can tell a lot of speech in a way that I can &apos;t talk about , or not in a way to close your eyes — that violence is women and women .
There are some of the reasons I &apos;m going to decide .
First of all , it &apos;s the wrong explanation of the religious fiction , the holy writer , the <unk> , the <unk> , the new Western , the <unk> .
They &apos;re using these rules to make sure that women are often the same as a child in the same way that the men are in the future .
A few years ago , in 2000 , I was using a company called <unk> , and I was using a company called <unk> in the 70 years — I thought , I still began to turn on to the school school every day , and I &apos;m going to have to say , I &apos;m going to turn on to be a <unk> , and in Southern india , I was going to turn off — I &apos;m going to be a black man in the United states , and we had decided to think about the great men
So they were <unk> , which is the way that women can be sacred , their wives , the <unk> , the <unk> , or the spirits of the army , if the woman is in the Southern state of a <unk> , and she can &apos;t turn off if a boy in the room has been taught , and then you can see the woman in the room , and then in the more than the top of the world , which is that women don &apos;t have to learn a man , and that &apos;s not .
But the key is that the laws are wrong in order to keep the men in more high condition .
It &apos;s a common-sense problem , because men can use power , for example , when you &apos;re a husband or husband , you want to be women .
So , why do I have to pay them to do more than the same thing ?
What we have to do is we &apos;re looking back against violence .
In the u.s. , the u.s. , for example , we had a huge decline of <unk> out of the poor , and the most likely of the people who were used in prison .
One of 1,000 Americans are in prison .
( Laughter ) Now , the people with 1,000 people are in prison .
It &apos;s a devastating amount of growth .
Since I left my father &apos;s house , there was a million miles of dark women in prison .
We &apos;re one of the poorest countries on the ground , and he &apos;s going to be a <unk> early on the Earth .
We &apos;re going to take a place in a place where we &apos;re going to meet the world .
We &apos;ve been in California , and I found myself on the other day that California had four billion dollars per capita mortality .
So we can go to the early age .
Earthquakes , eight weeks later , it was a law that was diagnosed with violence and the loss of loss to the poor and homeless people that are the other causes of violence in women .
I &apos;m going to be short .
One of them is picked up the tents .
But in some of the countries , in many countries , when they &apos;re born a little girl , shortly in her life , she was a kind of <unk> , and she &apos;s a kind of <unk> , which is a <unk> , a little bit of a woman , a little girl , a little girl .
Hours , hours later , there are more likely more likely to get out there .
And then when she comes to marry , it turns out that there was no way to do that .
It &apos;s not rare , although it &apos;s not going to do the wrong thing .
So , in fact , for example , the percentage of all the women who lived in the same day are today that had a humiliation of happiness .
Some countries have more than 98 percent of women , and they &apos;ve got the consequences of steel .
It &apos;s a terrible disaster for all women in the world .
Another one is a really good thing — a family member of the wrong explanation is nothing nothing in the koran , which is the mystery of the girl &apos;s family , and if she had to be married , or hours , even if she can marry or die or hours .
It &apos;s a member of his family , and the family becomes an insurance , when a young man is rewarding to the family .
Not so much about this project , but it showed that 75 percent of these workers have been tried for women , parents and brothers , 25 percent of the rights of women .
The other problem that we have in the world in the world of women and women are slavery , or gandhi , what we call it now .
About a million million people have been in the new world in new York in 18 years .
30 million people lived in slavery today .
The u.s. government Department may be able to do that for every year , and the state of the police account to send out all of the world &apos;s borders from the world , 80 percent of all these women — women who have sex with sexual slavery .
The United states is in this moment , 60,000 people in the world are under oxygen or in slavery .
Atlanta , Georgia , where the center of the world and I have been studying by the university of <unk> , and 200 and 300 women , people who are in the world .
It &apos;s one room in the country .
The Atlanta has a lot more <unk> .
If you want to make a mistake , you can make it better for a hundred years .
The white woman is able to be able to lead to the <unk> of the city in the middle of the atlantic .
The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
So this is another very serious problem , because there &apos;s no mess in America , in the local , the local , or the boss of the police .
It &apos;s about one of the worst problems that women work , and women are bought and sold all the countries in the world .
Now , Sweden may come up with this .
And 20 or 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change law , and women are not more likely to sue the world , if they &apos;re in sexual slavery , but the press of the mess , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> .
In the United states .
On the one man , the 25 percent of women had been killed in the u.s.
Canada , <unk> , I &apos;ve already been told , Sweden , France , France , other countries moving into it .
It &apos;s the other thing that can be done .
We have two big schools in the country , our army and the great <unk> university .
They have a <unk> .
The last thing I did , I said , what happened to the army , I &apos;m still .
Only 3,000 , more than one percent of the number , and the reason is that a team of organizations , like the two boats , the <unk> , the <unk> mars rover — the kamal of the law of the world , is a team who has a law on law enforcement , and of course , the last one that they want they were , under their <unk> , they don &apos;t do it .
This law has to be changed .
We &apos;re going to be sexually assaulted at the end of the day , and now , I have a lot of gear , and it &apos;s partly because of my book and yet , in fact , there is 89 university in college , in America , in the <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , because the service of people are protecting people to protect them from sexual violence .
The ministry of law says , on the university of universities , I &apos;ve been doing it all over the way that I &apos;m going to take a university of <unk> , if you have a crime in somebody , but when they &apos;re really interested in college campuses .
They &apos;re not the same .
These are things that happen in our society .
The other thing that &apos;s very serious , right ?
When I was the president , there was 39 percent .
So we &apos;ve gone out of the same thing , and this is — ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24 percent of the past 15 years .
It &apos;s what happens to you .
When we take 500 companies , 23 years of leadership leadership , 500 , and so leadership , I &apos;ll tell you that you &apos;re getting more than more leaders .
It &apos;s what happens in our country .
Another problem with the United states is we &apos;re not in the world .
We found a war on the world war ii .
Hours of ours had been on the ground .
In other , we were walking around , you know , <unk> people .
Hours of course , we &apos;ve got a lot of them .
We were going to war with 25 different countries , or more world war ii .
For four years , I won &apos;t tell you , we didn &apos;t have — ( Applause ) — we don &apos;t take a million of them , we didn &apos;t have a weird .
But in any case , the things that we have , from the violence and the wrong explanation of saint einstein is the leading causes of violence against women .
Another one of the most important people , the men , don &apos;t get to get off .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
It &apos;s a guy who may say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m a <unk> condition . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very similar to when I was a small , when it comes to <unk> and <unk> .
Race was in the middle East , 1865 , war between the state , the <unk> war , when linda <unk> <unk> are going to be the same .
But at that time , there was a lot of white people who didn &apos;t think they were in the state of the state , but they silence , because they used to be very <unk> at the jury of the jury , the best schools and the other .
Even if they say , &quot; &quot; I am confronted by the state of the state of the state , and they &apos;re struggling .
People who are learning from the <unk> system , most of the men , the nsa , the nsa system , most of the men who have the government in the world , and most of the men who have a big religious .
What is the key to do today ?
I would say , the best thing that we could do for women in the world , and that &apos;s where you come home , Europe and so far , who may have the potential to be responsible for ourselves to be more than to be able to end with a <unk> state in the world .
Well , I &apos;m not a woman woman saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to say .
But I hope that after this conference , women have sent their <unk> , the violence on college campuses in the world , etc . , and in the future of the labor market , we need to protect the <unk> and <unk> .
I have 12 <unk> , four kids who are talking about , and I think I &apos;m about to say , and I want to say , and I want to say , &quot; &quot; I want to say , &quot; &quot; And I want to say , &quot; &quot; I want all of you to join the world &apos;s rights for women in the world , and I hope that all of you are going to come to me for the world for women in the world , and protect them right in the world .
Thank you very much .

When I was here in Oxford , in the &apos; 50s , &apos; 90s , it seemed like a <unk> .
The growth of the population was stopped .
The world &apos;s greatest voice .
The cancer of the cancer that has been developed during the world , has been taken away by our lives .
The oxygen flows around the forest .
Oil was gone , and the <unk> <unk> would come up .
Nothing was going to happen . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the middle of the population in the middle of the population on the average of the person in the world , in the real world as a result of <unk> <unk> .
When I was at the middle of my life , it was 30 percent .
A child mortality in the two .
Productivity is per capita .
One of the things that has become more flowering of what was going to grow up ?
The size of the project shows the size of the size of the population , and this graph is the GDP per capita .
To try to answer this question , you have to understand how human beings are coming out of the same information , and they can create their capacity to adapt to the new and <unk> .
In other words , you need to figure out how to get money .
I want you to imagine what we were going to do with creating these kinds of things .
Over 30,000 generations .
And then , of course , there were some change , but the mechanics changed the skeleton of the entire body .
It &apos;s a phenomenal phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s about five years ago on the right side of the project .
The other thing is not the same .
So with all sorts of new materials , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And more than that , with all sorts of different ideas — the <unk> , the internet , the <unk> , the <unk> .
They were connected to this technology .
And that &apos;s also a different technology , and this is a wonderful technology , and I think it &apos;s a key to what &apos;s going on in the world .
My body is also a kind of <unk> , the idea of the skin of the brain , the idea of the brain , the idea of the printing .
They brought together together .
How do you create something in the same way in North America ?
It uses a <unk> .
It &apos;s very unlikely when it comes from two different mutations in different ways .
One month , we &apos;ve survived .
In fact , it was possible to be able to be able to be able to get the same kind of <unk> in the <unk> of the supermarket .
So here &apos;s the thing that keeps us alive with the genetic innovation of all of us .
It &apos;s not a <unk> .
So what &apos;s the effect of that effect is that the cultural revolution that I have in the biological evolution of my life ?
I think the answer is , it &apos;s not the same thing that we do .
It &apos;s a <unk> human .
There are no animal animals .
Culture can not exist .
Maybe there &apos;s a <unk> culture .
It has a culture that has a culture .
They &apos;re only one of the other ones that they have from the parents &apos; parents .
And we &apos;re going to break the stones .
But the difference is not the same .
And this is the size of a whole bunch of cultures around the world .
And there &apos;s no way to get there .
So why do you improve your life standards ?
The answer was to say that he was in the &apos; 50s .
And he thought that he had a version of the camera , and he had a conference that he explained in a term called gandhi to the world .
Adam tells me about four hours and hours after three hours .
Oz will weigh the clock and pick up for two hours .
It &apos;s the best thing that I can do with Adam and <unk> .
It &apos;s got to be nepal .
He can do their own <unk> and their <unk> .
And if you &apos;re going to grow two or two of them , you can see that if you can grow up with two or two , you &apos;re going to see how to grow up with two or two .
And so , for example , there are a lot of interventions that make a lot further off , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
Adam and Oz <unk> at the hour of his time .
Ask yourself : How long you needed to work , the clock of the desktop , for her to stop the book .
When you first start , you have to buy a village .
How much are you going to do that ? We &apos;ve got a lot of time .
How many of you have to work on the clock at a second point of time , and if you have the head of the world in the UK ?
In the United states .
You &apos;re going to win with the <unk> seconds of your well-being , compared to 1950 .
You have to take 15 minutes , and you can get the equivalent of being more like this .
You had to work six hours to get a drink in order to infect the clock .
So we &apos;re going to go back and find out how to do this for the people who are doing it ?
The data on the right was all about to do other people .
How many of you did it ?
<unk> ? Hundred hundred ?
You know , I think millions .
I can &apos;t tell you .
And that &apos;s how the society works .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re going to have as a biological form .
I had the clock if you were the bahamas , and the people were literally on you .
They did it by <unk> , and that &apos;s what they did , and they were doing a bad reason , and so on .
The people in every day , he was calling him for dinner .
But the contemporary of a tourist , which is the same as the <unk> of a human being in a living room .
They &apos;re in <unk> , coffee , grocery shops , and they &apos;re going to give you a nice food store in the clock , and you &apos;ll be able to be able to be able to be able to get a little bit of light .
We need to be treated every single one .
In fact , there are other animals who are working on one another .
The ant is a great example .
The queen is responsible for the plant .
Even in England , we don &apos;t stop the russians .
( Applause ) So , what did that happen ?
It was the room .
But I have no evidence .
There was a lot of work for food .
They work with men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it &apos;s useful for being <unk> .
And she knows .
And the man knows that they don &apos;t have to drip to stop korea .
Everything that we need to do is transfer channels .
And the Neanderthals were not doing this .
They were very high .
They were very sensible .
But there are no evidence that they had a lot of work .
There &apos;s no evidence of all the women .
She looks like women were growing together .
And there are no limits of separation from a group , because the early ones in the world , they &apos;re all about <unk> , and the tools they were doing is always built with local buildings .
For example , there &apos;s a place where there were hundreds of places in the middle of the world , where the Earth has seen a place .
They &apos;re always built on the local shell .
The same thing that has been seen in the world is that there &apos;s a lot of people who have a lot of modern people in the world .
When the human started to move things like this , it &apos;s evidence that they were getting out of the group .
Gandhi , we &apos;re going to go back to the old <unk> .
And early detection of this , it comes out for 20 thousand years ago , where we see that <unk> , <unk> and other things that have to be large , from Ethiopia .
And also , as a result , there were <unk> miles , and we had 200 miles of <unk> <unk> .
And this is the fact that the groups of the beginning began .
And that led to the staff .
They signed up with their neighbors &apos; neighbors &apos; til in a way to do things like <unk> , and then they found some <unk> .
What happens when you remove the limits of the limits , where are you going to have to be <unk> ?
And the answer is that it &apos;s not just the future of technology technology , but even it can also turn into the opposite direction .
This example is called Tasmania .
The Western <unk> compared to the people with the <unk> , and they have actually been <unk> .
Because there was a lot of people who had 4,000 people who had a lot of money to support the staff of the skills they needed to do .
And yet , there was nothing like that .
The reason is , it &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of South America .
The tasmanian devil was known .
Come back again , and ask yourself , not just who did it , but who knew how to do that ?
Nobody was one .
The person on the base line , you don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m not , of course , famous famous <unk> <unk> , the age of the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a teenager , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not a little <unk> . &quot; &quot; And nobody knows how to do it , because people don &apos;t know how to get a graph , because people don &apos;t know how to get the graph , because they don &apos;t know how to go out of the trees , and they don
What we did in modern societies , the way we can relate to specialization , we created an opportunity to do things that we don &apos;t even know .
It &apos;s not like samantha .
But with the technology of technology .
In fact , I &apos;m not interested in the argument about the age of an intellectual , or it has a few more iq than other groups .
It &apos;s absolutely not matter .
So society has a matter of how good ideas are going on , and how they &apos;re <unk> , not as many of the individuals .
We created a collective brain .
We &apos;re clicking on <unk> .
We are neurons in this brain .
The language of ideas , the <unk> and the <unk> , is not the only one that we have , and yet we &apos;re going to move the steps .
It &apos;s less and less wrong .
In the future , as we go back , it &apos;s a little bit different .
Future war , depression , natural disasters .
These are things that are happening in this century , I &apos;m absolutely confident .
But I also believe that because the nature of the future , the people who are able to experience the experience , and the way we can see them as much as I can still know , I &apos;m confident that technology will be able to come up .
Because in the <unk> , through crowdsourcing , the power has been sent to their ideas .
Thank you .
