It was a <unk> afternoon .
He was working scientific science in the world , the world &apos;s democratic freedoms .
I loved it with my work , but precisely that day felt a little bit of <unk> .
So I went to close to my roommate , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to myself , I &apos;m sorry to do that , and I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m sorry .
Chris took 30 percent of working on the bottom , so he knew the way the institutional functions .
I told you that I felt a bit of work .
I was doing a series of issues about the intersection of science and liberal freedoms : very interesting .
But I wanted to <unk> on the more problems in face , a way that I could take a difference .
Chris was going to go back to big and ask , &quot; &quot; All of those questions are , what are the five that you feel to be ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; It &apos;s from the nuclear speech , <unk> technologies , <unk> <unk> .
Oh , there &apos;s also a great thing , the job of <unk> as a <unk> of lies .
Of course , the topic of genetic therapy . &quot; &quot; Genetic traits ?
&quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s the patent for human genes . &quot;
&quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , no ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot;
Can I tell you that the American government headaches from the body of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; I went back to my <unk> and I &apos;m saying to three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he arrived at hundreds of thousands .
&quot; &quot; Lightning ! You &apos;re right ! Who is right now . Who &apos;s right ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what Chris is a big lawyer , but it didn &apos;t know almost anything about <unk> and <unk> patent absolutely .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t a lawyer , a lot less lawyer lawyer .
He was clear that there was a lot of learning to learn before to find any one .
First , we had to know exactly what <unk> you when you have a gene .
Genetic therapy used so many different kinds of claims , but the most discussed of all are called &quot; &quot; DNA &quot; &quot; Or &quot; &quot; Or &quot; &quot; — is a piece of DNA that comes from a cell .
The <unk> of this say , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t patent your genes in your body , we avoid the genes , and the truth is true , but the radical problem that you need to harbor the genes to use them .
And patent doesn &apos;t cover a particular gene in particular , but all the positive versions of that gene is .
And what does that mean ?
Because you can &apos;t pass your genes to a physician and ask them to pass this , to see if you tell them , if you give them mutations , without the permission of the patent .
It also means that the patent ceremony has the right to stop that that gene is given by research or clinical trials .
Allow us to make a child , a lot of private companies , close to human beings , closed the parts of the human hemisphere was affecting their patients .
We have the case of deception , a small <unk> of age , long enough , a heart disease , which is if it &apos;s not , it can affect the death .
The company that patent the two genes associated with this disease can create a test for diagnose .
But then they walked into <unk> and they never got this cell .
But the company that the <unk> company threatened by affordable <unk> by <unk> patent .
Two years without stopping the answer .
During that time , I had been diagnosed with nothing to diagnose .
Genetic traits were a problem that belongs to patients .
Could there be a way of doing the front of it ?
So it turns out that the Supreme court left of course in a long list of cases before , that there &apos;s a series of things that are not supposed to patent .
You can &apos;t afford products of nature : air , water , minerals , the elements of the periodic table .
Neither is laws of nature : the law of gravity , and = = mc2 .
They &apos;re very fundamental things , and it must be the range of everyone , and they should have the rest of us .
In our opinion , the DNA of the most life , that encode the production of all of our proteins , it &apos;s both a product of nature as a law of nature , regardless of what &apos;s found in our bodies or in the bottom of a test .
To understand the best , we traveled around the country to talk with instincts experts , scientists , professional physicians , lawyer , patents , patents .
Most of us were told that we had a reason for a political point of view , and when we were in theories , since a legal point of blindness .
All of them thought that the chances of getting into our own face was so much like it .
But why ?
It turns out the patent troll has issued these <unk> over 20 years .
Literally , there were thousands of patents in human beings .
The patent court was very disappointed in the status quo , the biotech industry has grown up with this practice , and the <unk> went to regularly <unk> the genetic patents to be passed over year after year , no longer got away .
Briefly , the courts weren &apos;t going to be willing to <unk> these patents .
More and not , and I &apos;m afraid to give us the feedback loops , and that you said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re right enough , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re right in the most <unk> to keep fighting .
So we started to fix our cause .
Patent traits used to be : company to aggregate a company to B for a technical subject , dark and confused .
We were not interested in the kind of causes , and we think that our cause is a lot more .
It was the <unk> and scientific freedom , the doctor &apos;s hand .
So we decided to open a cause that &apos;s not just the typical that there is patent , but because of the human rights .
We &apos;ve been able to identify a genetic device to get it in charge of their patents to then organize an <unk> range of experts and experts who tell them to court workers like these patents come from patients and innovations .
We think that the ideal candidate to find it is that we have the <unk> candidate that we had , and yet , in the same time , we had to do this , and we thought , well , what do you do that ?
I mean , I &apos;m going to show you that the same thing that I &apos;m going to do is to tell you about your own eyes .
The women with certain mutations in these genes have more likely to be <unk> from alzheimer &apos;s disease .
A complete secure about the testing of the United states .
He did a lot of laboratory rats would give up to a test of tests .
They covered a card by their exams , over 3,000 dollars .
They were just sharing their data at the scientific community of the international community .
And if it reaches the worse , for a period of several years , I would argue that they &apos;re going to be their own examination , and they have additional additional mutations that were identified by a team of researchers in France .
It was that during that period , for several years , until a 12 percent of the women who had to get out to be a wrong answer , a negative outcome that should be positive .
This is psychotic .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) the quote of <unk> , Eileen , has developed cancer with 40 years and did it exams .
The <unk> gave negative .
The <unk> king .
The most likely that was that cancer wasn &apos;t there in the family , so the other family members did not need to do the exams .
Over two years later , the diagnosed I was diagnosed with an <unk> <unk> .
It turned out that the quote from <unk> found that 12 percent of people who received received a fake negative negative .
If we <unk> <unk> the result , I was allowed to give you a test , and would you avoid her own pancreatic cancer .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that you could imagine these problems .
They make genetic code , they organized organized organizations , four scientific organizations that were able to represent more than 150,000 scientists and professional professionals , and women who are not right to pay for exams and respected , or they wanted to make a second point they couldn &apos;t afford to give up because of the patents .
One of the main things that we faced when we prepared this case was to think the way to explain consciousness .
To make sure that what I was doing is not an investment , and the genes that were <unk> from nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts like this : what is a gene ? What is DNA ?
How is that DNA , and why is it not an investment ?
We spend hours and hours of our many <unk> and <unk> , trying to give them the way to explain these concepts that we can easily make sure .
And at the end , we end up by hand hand by the metaphor , like the gold .
So I isolate DNA is like <unk> out of a <unk> or a river from a river .
You can patent the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t patent the gold .
It has so much impossible for you to extract the gold gold for you ; you can &apos;t patent , then you get a gold gold .
And the gold , again from <unk> , you can use all kinds of things that you couldn &apos;t even have when it was in the mountain ; with you can get them around , for example , but you can &apos;t patent the gold because you &apos;re safe and you &apos;re still terrified .
In 2009 , we were ready to consider the case .
We &apos;ve done this last year , the new York court district in new York , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> , at <unk> , for example .
In March of 2010 , the judge emits his <unk> : <unk> .
When you read your opinion , you print the <unk> that I describe the science in the case .
I mean , ours — I &apos;m really good , but not so good .
How could it develop a really clever knowledge about the subject ?
We couldn &apos;t just imagine how it &apos;s possible to be like this .
So it turned out that the trial and I was working on the judge of that , not just a lawyer — it was a scientist .
And not just a scientist — I had a phd in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Wow !
And then he appealed to the <unk> court driver &apos;s <unk> .
And here are things involved .
First , in a life moment of this case , the government of the United states has gone .
In the court court , the government emits a report to the style of <unk> .
But in contrast to their own official officers , the government has found a report to what I said to reconsider this subject to the light of the court court , and I think that DNA is not a matter of being <unk> .
This was very important , and totally unexpected .
The federal court manager of the federal court has all the patents cases , and it &apos;s known to his reputation , very personal medicine .
So even with this geiger rate , we were missing with losing .
And so it was .
More or less .
So it was about two against one .
But two percent of the judges that vote against us , they did it because of all different regions .
The first , the brilliant judge has created his own life and new biological theory , totally wrong .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to show you a little bit like this .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do , but I &apos;m going to tell you that I didn &apos;t know that . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to
The other judge , Moore &apos;s judgment , said that I would agree with us how to be the DNA of a product of nature .
But , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t want to <unk> the biotechnology industry . &quot; &quot; The third , the judge was given me the reason .
You have to take a question you burn with the court .
By the generation , these questions are in the form of a <unk> paragraph , a kid who had a bunch of americas , where &quot; &quot; And &quot; &quot; So .
We did that , and it &apos;s the greatest question I &apos;ve ever received .
Five words : They can &apos;t have genetic genes ?
When Chris asked me what I thought about the words , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
I think you &apos;d have to say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
I want the judges to have the same reaction I had the day that I talked about this subject seven years ago . &quot; &quot; And of course , I was going to tell me ?
The Supreme court only asks you about one percent of the cases that he gets , and he hated the ours .
It comes the day of the <unk> , and it was very , very exciting — with many people out of people , people who raised up to the last two , 30 of the morning to try to get in the judge .
Two organizations against the <unk> of the chest , organize the demonstrations of the <unk> .
Chris and I took together on the hallway , moments before he &apos;s defending the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous .
But all of the panic that I &apos;ve seen when I walked into the room and I saw that around a bunch of known names : women who know it and how to break their personal stories , their peers who sacrificed their own personal stories , their peers who sacrificed those very long time of the <unk> who are looking at <unk> to court .
In the room , they were three leaders of human genome project , including the <unk> of the DNA , James Watson , who has found a report to the court , in which he said that patent genes was an &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) the diversity of the communities represented in the room and the contributions that each one thought he was doing to do this day was that much of the things we had in the game .
The joy was frustrated .
( Applause ) Chris claimed , bright .
But for me , the most passionate thing is to see the judges of the Supreme court trying to understand the DNA isolated , as a matter of analyzing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> way that I had done our legal team for the last seven years .
The bias is associated with the DNA of <unk> around the Amazon .
The <unk> <unk> that you &apos;re going to associate with a <unk> , from a tree .
And what no doubt was my favorite moment , the judgment of being determined to the ground &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) when we left that day from the <unk> , we sat very confused , but he would never hit the result , nine out of scratch .
A natural circuitry of DNA is a product of nature and it &apos;s not susceptible to be <unk> even because it was isolated .
And what &apos;s more , I didn &apos;t have done anything . &quot; &quot; <unk> and four hours after deciding , five labs after the decision , five labs at the end , they would have shown that they would offer up to the test for the genes .
Some of them promised to offer the most cheaper testing .
Some of the promise to take a look for an additional examination , that it would take a <unk> .
But the purpose of court has been behind behind .
He ended up with a practice of 25 years that <unk> to human genes in the United states .
It has eliminated that suffering from technology and machine research .
And he helped the patients as though I was concerned , and Eileen had to take care of the exams that they needed .
A few weeks later that the court emits his decision , I got a little <unk> in the mailbox .
It was about Bob <unk> , a professor of beethoven university , and one of the first people that I &apos;ve been Chris to visit was to be a professor of <unk> university .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ve been focusing on a lot of this case .
Part of what has led the courage to tackle those risks is that we were doing the right thing .
The process lasted for almost eight years since the beginning to date , with many <unk> and unpredictable eyes .
Of course , it helped me , but it was the communities that we connect and and the alliance we create , the ones that give us to us .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hello . I &apos;m going to show you a few commercials , eight of my projects , made of collaborative <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to call it &amp; &amp; d <unk> , and we &apos;re working in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , and what I call &quot; &quot; The phone <unk> . &quot; &quot; Inspired to be a great person , I &apos;m inspired to be a great thing that I was asked for me to be doing that for me , almost like I was an extension of your body : turning the lights or take a water of a water , and you turn into the water or a bottle of tobacco .
When I grew up , the thing was worse and start to see how a form of control .
Of course , I can &apos;t tell anything not because it was a very <unk> figure .
What I love to love was <unk> his use of the phone .
He would <unk> his <unk> and gave her to March the number for him .
And in response , and as a gift for my great uncle , I did him , &quot; &quot; The phone was great . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s so long that they &apos;re missing two people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way that my uncle uses a phone phone for a person .
The problem is , when I was home , I went to college , I started to stop at their order .
So I did a <unk> machine that I could give you its order to find the order of the <unk> and the whole world .
What I had to do was take a paper , put the role in the car , writing the email , or command and the paper .
This device will send automatically to the person in a way of email control .
So here you can see that we have a lot of electronic electronics that understands all the mechanical Action and become digital in digital .
So my great story is just a mechanical interface .
And since then , the object has to be great and have a <unk> game , as I like my great uncle .
The next job is an amazing device that is called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the harmful of being surrounded by a tribe , <unk> , sweet .
So this works like this . We have these spots here on the wall and behind , we have these little creatures that move out of it .
We see ourselves in silence , intimacy .
And if there &apos;s more silence , they &apos;re <unk> .
And at the same , they &apos;re providing awareness .
So we have these clustering on the walls of a room .
And we had a couple of these little pigments socks behind .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a video for the video .
When there &apos;s silence , they go behind the board behind the sky , and they go back to the sky .
And they look like humans or the real creatures .
And you get immune to the sounds that you &apos;re going to get out there .
They don &apos;t respond to the sound sounds .
You hear a train at a moment when you don &apos;t respond .
( Noise ) But they respond to the sound in the foreground . You think of that in a second .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) we work very hard to do the most realistic thing .
Each pigments has its own behavior , a disorders of humor , personality , etc .
This is a very premature prototype .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We made that respond to people , but we saw that people were quite playing with child and child .
This is a video game called &quot; &quot; The person who &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; We were quite intrigued by the idea of play with the ignorance of invisibility .
What would it be possible to experiment invisibility ?
We &apos;ve worked with a company in specialized lab cameras , and we give them to create software with us using a camera that could look at people in the room , next to these people and replacing the person in the room , going to the invisible .
I &apos;m going to show you a very premature prototype .
The right , you can see from my colleague , <unk> , is in space .
And on the left , you &apos;ll see the dark video where the camera takes it .
Take advantage in the fourth . It makes it invisible .
You can see how the camera is safe and rubber .
It &apos;s a premature video , so we still have no solar cell and all of that , but perfectly perfectly quickly .
And we did this in a room where there was a camera looking at space and we had a monitor on each wall .
And two people went into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except for a difference , a person who is constantly constantly where you want to move in the room .
This job is called &quot; &quot; The Shadow of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a piece of paper , as a result of a child &apos;s width of an <unk> road .
So in front of that object seemed to be very strong and robust , and on the side , almost disappear .
People walked into the room and almost ignore it thinking that it was somewhere in the place .
But in the corner of the black , you start a branch of the wall in a very beautifully .
You would remember , and I always broke it .
( Laughter ) This is a job from a man from a man &apos;s sleeve .
His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , which seems to be in the <unk> and its body and it &apos;s grown out of it as a plant .
What &apos;s going to move around his head , as you &apos;re wearing a <unk> movement .
It &apos;s like thank you through that circle .
Because if that circle wasn &apos;t there and the soil out of the ground , you start to keep it across space .
And there are no wires .
So I &apos;m going to show you an example . When people go into the room , it is activated .
And very quickly , in a few minutes , they &apos;re going to be <unk> , take and speed and look at it &apos;s time to fall .
This is an important moment because we want to infuse the viewer a whole instinct of almost going and help or save the subject .
It doesn &apos;t need to be the thing because he &apos;s getting up again again .
This job was a really specific technique for us and we &apos;re very hard , like most of our jobs , for years to get a mechanical , a balance , a perfect performance .
It was very important to us to make the exact moment at the exact moment when it was , because if you do it so that you lose the balance , then they would have it , and if you didn &apos;t release enough , it doesn &apos;t infuse that fatal , or maybe the effect of wanting to go to the help .
I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we do a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my <unk> . Let me go .
Now you &apos;re just nervous , so it &apos;s going to take it .
But it doesn &apos;t need to do it , because it can stand up for itself .
This is a job that we were very intrigued by , with the <unk> of the skin , with thousands of different sizes of optical fiber , that shine a coma .
And it &apos;s at night tonight .
So we engaged this round of one drop with fuzzy <unk> , who was posted on the party .
The idea was to contain something cold and distant and abstract as the universe with a familiar piece of <unk> , which is very <unk> and intimate .
The idea was that somewhere in the moment you would let you look at a way of a fuzzy <unk> , you know about how you get a hole in the space , like you &apos;re looking at a night sky .
This is the last job , still in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; Imagine imagining a very nice picture of you in the room of the room , and as you &apos;re looking at it , you try to intimidate you and become a cube twice and high , four times their volume .
This object is in constant and expand and interaction to create a <unk> with people in the operating room , as you try to hide a secret on their together , and something like this .
We work with a lot of technology , but actually not as we like , because it &apos;s very suffering in our work for years and years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that help us emotions and patterns of behavior in these creatures that we create .
When a creature comes to the mind , and almost like the process of creating it was to find the way that this creature wants to exist , that you want to take it and you want to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start by eggs a useful useful for technology and everything I need for you is this : that change in the way for two minutes .
But before I <unk> it , I want to ask you now now that you &apos;re looking at your body and what you &apos;re doing with him .
See , how many of you are in some ways ?
<unk> , <unk> legs , <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes we put your arm on it .
Sometimes we were . ( Laughter )
Pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to go back to this in a few minutes and I hope you can see it a little bit powerful can change the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re fascinated with the body language , and it &apos;s particularly in the body language .
You know , I &apos;m interested in this , it — wow — ( Laughter ) a metaphor of mine , a smile on a fire , a smile of <unk> , or a bit of a coma .
Narrator : Here are coming to the number 10 .
This police is lucky and go to the President of the United states .
There is the first Minister — no . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy Cuddy : a little bit of fun , and he &apos;s absent , and he &apos;s absent , and he &apos;s supposed to be told , he said , for a couple of years .
It was even the BBC and the new York times .
So when we think about verbal expression or body language , we call this mathematical scientist , we talk about language , so communication .
When we talk about communication , we think of communication .
What about your body language ?
What do you do with my own ?
Now , there are reasons to believe that it is valid this approach .
Sociologists like we spend a lot of time or from other people , about the judgment .
We do judgment and violence from body language .
These judgments can predict that important role in life like anyone who hired or promote or who we asked for a minute .
For example , like <unk> , researchers at the university of <unk> , showing that when someone sees 30 seconds of video game without your judgment of <unk> or <unk> or your doctor , I &apos;m going to tell you that when a physician is going to be a muslim or not .
So you don &apos;t have to see so much if the doctor was either or doesn &apos;t mean it or it &apos;s like it &apos;s gone .
Even more dramatic , Alex <unk> , particularly <unk> , we found that the judgment of the face of police policy I &apos;ve been on one second , the 70 percent of the career in the government and the Senate Senate , even in the digital , the emotional <unk> used to do the best of that business .
If you do a bad deal with them , it &apos;s bad idea , right ?
Talking about language language is to talk about how we judge the others , how to give us to us and what are the consequences .
But we tend to forget the other audience that influence our language , verbal words , that we are ourselves .
Influence our language language , our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
What language does I &apos;m talking about ?
They &apos;re a social psychologist . Study research , and I class in a competitive school , so I was inevitable that I was interested in the most dynamic dynamics .
It &apos;s been on <unk> and all of the express the words that I &apos;m going to be born .
What are the expressions in verbal machines and national ?
Well , that &apos;s why .
In the animal kingdom , you have to see the expansion , and it &apos;s not the same thing .
With a big , <unk> , <unk> , basically basically opened .
It &apos;s a shelter .
And it works like all the animal kingdom , which is the same thing .
It &apos;s not just prime .
Humans do do the same . ( Laughter ) They do that when they have a sustainable way to change and also when they feel powerful at the moment .
This is especially interesting because it shows the old and universal aspects of these qualities of power .
This expression , known as pride , has been studied by Jessica <unk> , which was called a <unk> <unk> .
That tells us that both the people who have been born in the same way , the people who are blind birth do the same when they win a physical competition .
So when you go to the goal line and won &apos;t matter whether you never saw anything .
They do that .
The arm in <unk> , wanting a high place .
What do we feel when we feel helpless ?
We do the opposite .
We shut up . We &apos;re involved .
You get very small .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> with who is on our own .
And so the animals that humans do really .
And this is what happens when you connect to power .
What we tend to do when it comes from power is to address language language .
So if somebody shows very powerful with us , we tend to do smaller . We don &apos;t imitate them .
We do the opposite .
And if I see this behavior in class , what ?
The times that students started around the language is not verbal verbal .
There are people who are <unk> of alpha <unk> , in the middle of the way they start to class , as they wanted to take space .
When they sit , they seem to expand .
Raise your hand .
So there are other people who engage with <unk> <unk> .
See his face in his face and his body , sitting in the chair , and they sit in the chair , and they do so when they go to hand .
Here &apos;s looking at two things .
One won &apos;t surprise you .
I just have to do with sex .
Women are more likely to do that men .
Women always feel less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I noticed is that I &apos;m also looking at the degree of participation of students and their level of participation .
And this is very important in class and because they participate in the media .
The schools that make them fight with the difference with the number of notes .
You see the men and men equally qualified , and then look at these differences in the notes , which seem to be attributed to part of participation .
And then I started asking me : if there are people who are struggling with that attitude and participating , we have to be able to do that .
Would it be possible to make anybody fake it , and that is the lead to participate more ?
My favorite <unk> , which is in Berkeley , and I want to know if you can pretend to be able to pretend it .
I mean , you can do it just for a present and try a result in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know that language language doesn &apos;t mean verbal , other people feel and think of ourselves . There are many tests .
But our question was : driving in language , does not verbal what you feel and think of ourselves ?
Now , there are patterns from that .
For example , we smile , when we &apos;re happy , but we also find why we &apos;re struggling to laugh .
It works in the two direction .
When it comes to power , it also works in the two direction .
When we feel powerful , they &apos;re more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we pretend to be powerful , they &apos;re more likely to actually make us feel powerful .
Because the second question was really , well , we know that the mind is our body , but it &apos;s also that the body is our mind ?
And when I say , in the case of powerful , what I &apos;m talking about ?
Because I think of thoughts and feelings and psychological components that form those thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I talk about hormones .
How is the powerful mind of the potential you &apos;re not ?
The powerful people tend to be , is not surprising , more selective and insurance , more optimistic .
They have the sense that they &apos;re going to make really a lot of games games .
They also tend to think of a more abstract way .
There are a lot of difference .
There &apos;s a lot of difference between the powerful and the ones that aren &apos;t .
Now , you &apos;re also also looking at the differences for two key hormones : testosterone , which is the hormone hormone , and the curtain , which is the hormone hormone .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in the general area have low levels of testosterone and levels of <unk> .
What does this mean ? To talk about power , they used to talk about the testosterone , because I had to do with national geographic .
But the power also has to do with our reaction to the stress .
Do you want a dominant leader with a lot of power , with high level of testosterone , sensitive sensation ?
Probably not , true ?
We want a person who &apos;s powerful , and it &apos;s dominant , but not very sensitive , but a lot of sensors , like a <unk> .
We know that in the primary generation of general , if a alpha must have control , if somebody has to take the control , then you suddenly see that paper in the moment of a few days , his testosterone goes round and the curtain is equally equally .
We have that evidence , that body can shape the mind , at least the <unk> level , and also that paper makes can shape the mind .
So what happens when it takes a change of paper ? What &apos;s going to happen at a minimum level , like this little manipulation or intervention ?
And we said , &quot; &quot; I want you to take a few minutes of your way , so that will make you more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to bring people into the lab and do a small experiment , those people who have adopted , for two minutes , both the positions , of power or , of course . I &apos;m going to show you right now five of them , but they &apos;re only going to take two .
This is one .
A couple more .
This is called the <unk> and the woman .
Here we have a couple more .
You can be standing , or sitting .
Here are the ways of being .
Now they &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re small .
This is very low power .
When I move the fisheries , you &apos;re <unk> .
This is what happens .
They come , it turns out in a jar , and we said , &quot; &quot; You have to do this or two . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of the positions .
We don &apos;t want to be <unk> with a concept of power .
We want to feel the power .
So that &apos;s about two minutes .
So we asked ourselves , &quot; &quot; As a powerful person ? &quot; &quot; And then we gave the opportunity to bet , at the end , we finally got another point of pointing .
That &apos;s all .
This is what we found .
It was <unk> at the risk , and we bet ; we find that when they are in a position that &apos;s a power to be able to bet with 86 percent .
When they are in the low positions , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant difference .
Let &apos;s see what we found with testosterone .
Now , in the normal place of the normal life , the powerful people experience an increase of 20 percent and the weak experience experience a decrease of 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
Now the results would cut .
The most powerful experience , or the top , the top will experience an increase of 15 percent .
Only two minutes to make these hormone change , how are you going to make your brain to do it , it &apos;s either not enough , or it doesn &apos;t feel that you can &apos;t be stressed , and you &apos;re feeling like it off .
We all know that feeling , you don &apos;t ?
It seems like our language doesn &apos;t verbal , so , in terms of ourselves , not only to the other , but we are .
The body can change the mind .
The next question , of course , is — can you see a power in a space that is going to be done ?
This is in the lab , this experiment , is just two minutes .
Where can you really apply this ?
That &apos;s what we care about .
We think that where you need to be in situations where they &apos;re evaluating themselves , like the most social situations that you &apos;re asking , how do you do it ?
Where they were evaluating even your friends .
For adolescents , it &apos;s at the table table .
For some people who are talking to school .
It can be by getting a business or to talk a little bit like this , or to get a job interview .
We chose one of the most people who identify what many people have done for their work .
So we published the results , the <unk> went and said , well , this is what you do when you go into a interview , right ?
( Laughter ) We &apos;re all wrong , and you said , no , for god , no , that &apos;s not what we wanted to say .
For a reason , no , don &apos;t do that .
Again , it &apos;s not about talking other people .
It &apos;s about speaking to you .
What do you do before going into a job interview ? Do you do this .
You &apos;re sitting there . Look at your iphone , or your Android , we &apos;re not going to leave any out of it out .
You give them your text , you &apos;re trapped , you give it small , when you really don &apos;t have to do this , maybe maybe in the bubble , is it ? It &apos;s about you .
That &apos;s what we want to evaluate , okay ?
We invited people into the lab , and they adopted adopted and lower power and then they went down and spend the way that they were going on .
( Laughter ) In the last few years , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you about five minutes of course .
They are also judged on the ground , and the judges are trained for not making behavioral minds like this .
Imagine that this person <unk> you .
For five minutes , nothing is worse than you would fail .
People tell this .
It &apos;s what <unk> <unk> is called &quot; &quot; In the social movement . &quot; &quot; This would be cut out .
This is the interview that we just have , because we wanted to see what happened .
We have been looking at the waist , four .
They don &apos;t know the chance . They don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have any idea that I have seen each person and by ending up all of these boxes , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , &quot; &quot; All of the positions of power .
We don &apos;t want to hire <unk> .
Did we give a greater positive feedback in general .
It &apos;s not about the speech on the speech .
It &apos;s about the presence of the presence of the speech .
Why do we evaluate what all of these different forms of this : the structural structures ?
Does it mean if they ?
These things don &apos;t affect . This and what it affects .
And this class of things .
Each person is going to be itself , basically .
They &apos;re what they are .
They have their ideas , for themselves , without any extra .
So this is what it means or <unk> in effect .
When I talk to people about this , that our body would change our mind and behavior can change our way of being , they tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) yeah ?
I say , <unk> it .
I &apos;m not like that .
I don &apos;t want to get there and felt like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want it a coma .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel that it wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is very important for me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an <unk> and feel feeling like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
When I was 19 , I suffered a terrible accident accident .
I was fired away from it , and I gave them a journey to go .
I got fired from the car .
I wake up in intensive care units with the wound in the head . They got to college at the university , and I was told that I was going to go to two . It was very traumatic .
I met my <unk> because they were told me , and I thought it &apos;s good for me .
So they gave me the university and tried to go back .
They said , &quot; &quot; You will not be able to finish the career .
You have to accept that there are other things you can do , but in your case this is not . &quot; &quot; I have to say that you can give your own identity , what really you can do , and I &apos;m saying that you can take your identity , what really is I think about it , it &apos;s the most exciting thing you can do .
I felt totally powerless .
And then I worked and worked , and I had a lucky , and I &apos;ve been lucky , and I worked .
Finally , a graduate student in college .
I took a few years older than my partners , and I got to convince somebody , my <unk> <unk> , Susan prize-winning , I &apos;m going to focus on , and I ended up at Princeton , and I felt like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
The night before the exhibition exhibition , the course of course , I think , is that I &apos;m going to show you how to do it .
That &apos;s that .
I was so scared of red and vulnerable , the next day that I call it , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave you . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t leave anything , because I bet for you and you &apos;re going to go .
You &apos;re going to go out , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;re going to do all the <unk> of your mind .
It just turns out to make it , and do it , and we do it , even though it was frightened or even paralyzed and having a <unk> experience , until it comes to the moment .
I &apos;ve got to go here . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years of teaching college , a few years ago , you know , in West , I went to Harvard , and I &apos;m at Harvard , I &apos;m at Harvard , I &apos;m not at this point , but for a long time I had the sense that he wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
The last of my first year at Harvard , a student who doesn &apos;t talk about class at the first time , to say they were , &quot; &quot; Hey , you must participate , or you can borrow , &quot; &quot; Came to my own . I didn &apos;t know it before .
Totally <unk> , he said , &quot; &quot; I should not be here . &quot;
That &apos;s my moment .
Because it happened two things .
The first one I realized , oh , oh , I don &apos;t feel that .
I wasn &apos;t feeling it , but she does it me in his place .
The second one , of course , must be here .
Let &apos;s see what you can do , and you can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . You should be here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
Now , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) to go to class and to give the best speech .
So I &apos;m going to show you a way that I can change it .
Now I want to tell you that there is no pretend to it .
You know it &apos;s going to transform it .
So there is to be enough to do this , and it &apos;s going to be transformed and <unk> it .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
Little changes can take the big transformation .
It &apos;s just two minutes .
Before you &apos;re looking at the next situation where you give you for a few minutes , I &apos;m thinking about it , on the edge , the fourth room , on the <unk> door , the door door slammed on the door .
This is what you have to do .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you what you &apos;re looking at , the brain , to make the brain to make the best of that situation .
It goes out to testosterone .
You don &apos;t get away from that situation that I &apos;m not going to show you who are .
Just from that situation with the sense of what I &apos;m going to tell you who is and I &apos;m going to show you .
I want to ask you before you have a chance of power , and I also want to invite you to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) Do you do , show you people in the people , because the best that can use them are those without the resources and technology , without any assistance .
They share with them because they can do it in private .
They only need their body , privacy and two minutes to change changes significantly in their lives .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And what I want to talk about is the most important problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about the green professor &quot; &quot; — probably probably that is a good thing .
( Laughter ) But what I &apos;m going to talk about is , what are the big problems in the world ?
And I should say , before I go , I asked them every single one of the ones that <unk> <unk> and paper , because I &apos;m going to ask you to help me see how we do it .
So you get a pencil and paper .
After all , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world out there .
I &apos;m going to just just take a few .
800 million people starve .
One billion people don &apos;t have access to water .
Two billion dollars .
There are millions of people dying in HIV and AIDS .
The ships continue .
Two billion people that are going to be affected by the climate change — and they go .
We have a lot , many problems around you .
In a ideal world , we would all agree , we don &apos;t do it .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solve all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do the question , the question I think we should do — and that &apos;s the reason why we &apos;re in the economy of that — is to say , if we don &apos;t really do that , we really really need to start asking , what problems we should solve ?
That &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask .
If we had to say , 50 billion dollars to spend the next four years to improve this world , what would we should spend ?
We identify the 10 of the greatest losses in the world , and it &apos;s just reading it , completely climate change , diseases of goods , education , education , instability and course , <unk> and trade .
We think that , in a lot of ways , we &apos;re going to have the big problems in the world .
The obvious question was to be asking , what are the biggest things ?
Why are we going to begin to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s just about asking a problem that &apos;s wrong with a creative problem .
In fact , that was the mantra of what was talked in Davos in January .
But naturally , there &apos;s a problem if you ask people to focus on problems .
Because we cannot solve problems .
Now the most important thing we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So the problem is not to make the problems , but we &apos;re constantly motivated by problems .
And it would be — naturally , it &apos;s a bit more complicated .
For climate change , it would be something like it .
For the <unk> diseases , they could be clinics or networks for mosquitos .
For the conflict , we would have the peace peace FORCE , and we could continue .
What I &apos;d like to ask you to try and ask you to try to do that , and that &apos;s 30 seconds — and I know that in a way that is something worthwhile , it &apos;s written by what you think they are the ultimate .
And also — this is naturally , where the economy went back — — what do we should not do it first .
What should be the end of the list ?
Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to the people , and just kind of what they should be the ultimate and the main asset of the solutions that we have for the biggest problems in the world .
The surprising thing of this process — of course , I mean , I &apos;d like to say , I only have 18 minutes I &apos;ve given you a number of my time , right ?
I &apos;d like to depth , and I think about this process , and that &apos;s what we actually did .
And also the recommended , and I &apos;m sure that we will also have this discussion over , so to think , how do we prioritize really ?
Since then , you know , if you ask yourself a question , why don &apos;t you have a list like this before ?
And one reason is that the performance is unbelievable <unk> .
No one wants to do .
Of course , all the organizations would want to be on the highest of a list like that .
But also all the <unk> organize was not in the highest .
And so there are many more &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; That number one , it &apos;s logical , not just wanting a list like this .
60 years ago there are the U.N. , and there &apos;s not the reason that there &apos;s a whole list of the big things that we can do in the world , and saying , what should we do first ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that we &apos;re not <unk> , each of them is a priority , so despite all of us who can prioritize even though it &apos;s just <unk> — and that &apos;s not likely that it &apos;s so good as we actually made a priority , and we &apos;re going to talk and we need to talk about that .
So what I &apos;m proposing to really mean that we had , for a very long period of time , a situation where there are multiple choices .
There are many , many things that we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , and sizes .
We didn &apos;t have an idea .
Imagine that in the restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what the price is .
You know that you &apos;re pizza , but you don &apos;t know how much cost it .
It could be a person , could they be $ 1,000 .
Could it be a familiar family . It could be an individual pizza .
We want to know these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s trying to do the Consensus in Copenhagen — is to put the price of these subjects .
And so basically , this was the process of Consensus in Copenhagen .
We have 30 percent of the world &apos;s economist in the world , three of each area .
So we &apos;ve heard three of the biggest economists of the planet writing about climate change .
What can we do ? What is your cost ? What &apos;s the benefit of doing it ?
The same with the <unk> diseases .
Three of the improved knowledge saying , what can we do ?
What will be the price ?
What would we need to do about that , and what would the result do ?
And so on .
Then we took some of the world &apos;s economist economist , eight of the greatest economists in the world , including three <unk> prizes , together in Copenhagen in may in 2004 .
We call &quot; &quot; Dream . &quot; &quot; The rather than the high university of Cambridge decided to call them as an official realm .
It works very well in Europe , but here &apos;s not so much .
And in fact , what they did , was to be a huge list .
And then ask you , why do you know ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy that I &apos;m going to do that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The subject is , of course , if you want to know about it , you ask a question about malaria .
If you want to know about climate , asking questions .
But if you want to know what two of you should solve , you can &apos;t ask any of those two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what the economists do .
They do .
They do that , not enough to say that we should do first , and we should do it after .
So this is the list , and this is the list I wanted to share with you .
Now , of course you also can see the web , and I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to talk about this as as a day .
So we &apos;ve created a list in which they said that there were bad things — basic , projects where we gave an operation , and a little less likely to be a result .
And then they were the right projects , the good and the <unk> .
And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects that we should start to do .
I &apos;m going to start from the last way that you can end up with the best of projects .
These were the bad ones .
As you can see at the end of the list is the climate change .
This is a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably probably one of the things about people who will say they shouldn &apos;t go back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why came out ?
And the truth , I &apos;m also trying to talk about this new thing , because it &apos;s probably probably one of the things that we &apos;re not going to agree with the lists that you &apos;ve heard about .
The reason that resulted in this morning is that it &apos;s — it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Oh — or do something else that &apos;s — it &apos;s very inefficient .
It &apos;s not saying that there &apos;s no global burden .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s not a big problem .
But that &apos;s what we can do for it is very little , very high cost .
The same thing to show up , the media of all the different models in the sky , and that &apos;s what if all the world was right now , it would only have 150 billion dollars per year .
That &apos;s an important amount of money .
Two or three times the help of the development that we add to the third world every year .
And to do very little .
All the models show that you put up that blindness on a six years ago .
So a guy in Bangladesh that is going to be a <unk> at the bottom , it can take a <unk> .
What &apos;s something well , but not very well .
So the idea and that , well , we spend a lot of money making something wrong .
And just by giving a baseline , the U.N. estimates that , half of that number , about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the main problems in the world .
We could deliver clean water , sanitation , schools , and toilets .
So we should ask , do we want to spend twice as well to do very little ?
Or then half of doing something incredibly complicated ?
And that &apos;s where it turns out into a bad project .
That &apos;s not saying that we have all the money in the world , we don &apos;t want to do it .
Everybody , that when we don &apos;t have it , it &apos;s not our first priority .
The right projects — I &apos;m not going to start with all — but not the <unk> diseases , scale of <unk> services — they &apos;re by just because , yes , the scale of basic health services is a big thing .
I would do a lot , but also , very much , but very much .
Once again , what it turns out and suddenly we started thinking about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , you find a lot of marketing projects .
Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you how much but we prioritize that should be , when less , the first thing to fix when we talk about how we should solve problems in the world .
The higher fourth test is malaria — treat malaria .
The age of malaria is about a couple of millions of <unk> infected every year .
It could even use one percent of the GDP per year for the United states .
If we invent a 13 thousand dollars in the next four years , we could actually build it up to half .
We could avoid the dying of 500,000 people , but what is most important , we could avoid that one billion people have infected every year .
It would increase significantly significantly to their ability to treat many other problems that have to deal with naturally .
The third is the <unk> .
Traditionally , the model showed that if we could be able to get the free and <unk> , and especially cut out of the uses and Europe , we could be able to lift the global economy in the West , and it was very large on a number of two billion dollars a year , half half what happened in the third world .
Once again , we could really take 200 to 300 million people from poverty , radically and very fast , and very fast , and very fast , between two and five .
That would be the third one thing we could do .
The second one thing would be would be hundreds of malnutrition .
They don &apos;t have a better way to treat malnutrition , but they are a very important way of treating malnutrition , that is , the lack of <unk> .
Traditionally , half the population of the world has no iron , <unk> , <unk> and vitamin d .
If you invest 12 billion dollars , we could do a deep tag in this problem .
This would be the second better <unk> that we could do .
And the best project would be hundreds of HIV / AIDS .
Traditionally , if we invest 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could avoid 28 million times of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this does and what it takes is that we have two very different ways of treating HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is forecast .
Once again , in a ideal world , we would do the two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of those two or where we don &apos;t do very well , we should be asking , how we would invest it first .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than forecast .
So <unk> , what this means is to say that we can do much more invested in the prediction .
It &apos;s also for the amount of money that you spend . We can do X for treatment , and 10 times more predict .
So once again , we have been focusing on more than in treatment , as first of the one .
What this does is do we really think about our priorities .
I &apos;d like to say to you for your list of just who you &apos;re saying , and you say , &quot; &quot; Well , do you do it ?
Or do you get something like that we &apos;ve done here ?
Well , of course , of course , one of the things is the climate change .
I find a lot of people who think it &apos;s very , but very little that we &apos;ve done that .
We should also make climate change , if there &apos;s no other reason , it &apos;s just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But , of course , we don &apos;t solve all the tests .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to do for you is that if we focus on the problems , we will focus on the right things .
In those of you who can do a lot better than little .
And I think , the truth is , Thomas <unk> , one of the participants of &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; It explained , very well .
One of the things you get on , and in 100 years , when you &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of climate change , people will be much , much richer .
And even though , I use the most <unk> impacts of the u.n.
I estimates that a average person in the developing world at the rate will be as rich as we are today .
And much more likely , you will be two to four times as rich as we are .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even more rich than that .
But the thing is , when we talk about saving people , help people in Bangladesh at the rate , we &apos;re not talking about poor poor .
We &apos;re talking about a <unk> .
And so the real subject , of course , that &apos;s saying , we want to spend a lot of money to help a little bit about a hundred years ago , a fairly netherlands <unk> ?
Or we want to help the poor people , these animals , in Bangladesh , who needs to help us , and who can help us very economically ?
Or as the <unk> said , imagine that there are a rich , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> thinking of 2005 and saying , &quot; &quot; How do you care so much to help me with a subject of climate change , and if you have so little to give my grandmother into command .
Even though you don &apos;t agree with the typical way to see this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s fundamentally , because climate change has a lot of good .
You know that you have &quot; &quot; Your day of &quot; &quot; — it sounds cool , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that I want to see , right , but I don &apos;t think that <unk> , let &apos;s pick up these shoes on the next movie , <unk> in <unk> , and something like that . ( Laughter ) Just just to a film .
So in many ways , I think the Consensus built in Copenhagen and all the discussion about the brain is a nsa of <unk> problems .
To make sure that it &apos;s not just to make it feel good , and you can see it .
It &apos;s not going to do the things that you have the biggest <unk> , but it &apos;s also going to be about places where you can actually do a good thing .
The other objections , I think , that &apos;s important , is that I have a handle on it , or we &apos;re — to compare a fake electricity .
Naturally , we should do it all in a ideal world — it would be completely agree .
I think we should do all the things , but we do not do it .
In the 1970 , the developed world decided that we were spending twice as we &apos;ve done , right now , that in 1970 in the developing world .
And it &apos;s just one of the most important thing about how to help us fall out of half .
We don &apos;t think we &apos;re in the way to solve all of the big problems .
In the same way , people also say , but what are the war of Iraq ?
You know , we spend a hundred billion <unk> . Why don &apos;t we spend that doing the right in the world .
I &apos;m full .
If some of you can talk to the Bush that it does that , right ?
But of course , the subject is still saying , if you have another 100 billion dollars , we will want to spend a lot better as much as possible , right ?
So the real problem , it &apos;s beginning to be new and thinking what are the right priorities .
Should I mention this , is this really the right list ?
You know , when you &apos;re asking the best economists in the world , the last final time , you end up asking you the white men and old people in the United states .
And they &apos;re not necessarily a really good way to look at the world .
So we added 80 young people around the world to solve the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying at college , and they speak with English .
Most of them were , first , in the developing room .
They had the same material but they could get a lot of the subject of the discussion , as they actually did , to extract their own lists .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and disease and the climate change .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There were many other people in the room and college students and different backgrounds .
They all had as a result of the same list .
And that &apos;s a great hope , really , to say that I think there is a way walking forward to start thinking about our priorities , and say , that &apos;s the most important world in the world ?
Naturally , in a ideal world , I would love to do it .
But if we don &apos;t do it , we can start thinking about where we start with ?
I see the Consensus of Copenhagen as a process .
We did in the 2004 , and we waited for many more people , to get a lot better information in 2008 , 2012 .
Design the right way for the world . &quot; &quot; But they also begin to think about violent violent politics .
To start thinking about , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t do things that we can make a little cost with a high cost , and the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but do you make it cool ? Where we can make a great good , low cost , right now . &quot;
If we care about a lot about some things , we end up not to worry about others .
So I hope that this will help us make the best of the priorities , and think about how we work better for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I got out of the house without any keys .
He just came home to visit a friend to visit a friend from the city of the city because the temperature would find the Earth scales .
And I was in the <unk> , looking for the pockets and I realized that I didn &apos;t have the keys .
In fact , you can see the window at the surface of the ground table , where the left left .
But they were all closed , and they &apos;re not closed .
I couldn &apos;t spend it night at home from my friend because I met at a while , and he &apos;d had a flight from Europe , and she would have to go down to the harbor and <unk> .
So , he &apos;s desperate and die of <unk> , and I took a window of paper and pick up the window to cover .
It &apos;s a lot of money to do that , but not just like a sudden leonardo morning at night .
Well , take the brain to understand what &apos;s happening .
It turns out it &apos;s cut out that the high rate rate is the same level of adrenalin .
So at the next morning when I got me after sleeping in , I worried about the window through the <unk> passage that I had to have in Europe had the mind that he had never experienced her .
And to get out of the airport , I don &apos;t realize that I forgot the past .
So I went back quickly to the house , with snow and ice , at 40 minutes I went on the harbor , and I went back to the airport , and I came back to the airport , and I came back to the airport , and I came back to the airport and I came back to airport and I arrived in the middle of the room .
Or , in case , there &apos;s a lot of things that we &apos;re trying to do with this , but in the case that there &apos;s nothing bad things , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
And Danny told me , &quot; &quot; And you &apos;re told , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been told , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been told , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been told , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been told , &quot; &quot; And you know , and you &apos;re told me that I &apos;ve been told , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m told , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been told that I &apos;m going to talk to you and tell me what I &apos;m going to tell you about . &quot; &quot; And he told
It was something that I &apos;m aware of the psychologist I hate to write about this was a few years ago and that you &apos;re called <unk> .
So , a team of experts who try to determine what happened , no ?
It &apos;s because in the dead , as it explained Danny , and then try to determine what you can do .
So I want to talk about today , and what I want to talk about today is what we want to talk about today is what we can do .
Some things are obvious , other are not so much .
I &apos;m going to start moving from evidence .
I ran up all over the house to the things that you lose .
Well , this looks like common .
There &apos;s a structure of the brain called the hippocampus of <unk> that has evolved during hundreds of thousands of years to remember the location of important things . Where is it , where you can fishing , where you can see the tribal and the allies .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that &apos;s the brain .
In fact , there was somebody who did the experiment to cut out the sense of smell of <unk> .
But it works well with things that don &apos;t move so much and not with stuff that &apos;s moving .
So there are some <unk> for the keys .
To the harbor , a specific pattern . The phrases of reading , on a specific table .
If you &apos;re going to a place and you &apos;re writing the things you &apos;re going to be in your place when you go back .
And when we traveled it , we took a picture of the screen and see the picture of the screen .
You &apos;re just looking at a <unk> with the photo to come with it .
These are similar things .
Remember that when you &apos;re stressed out , the brain emits cut .
The <unk> is toxic and it &apos;s the mind .
Now , you recognize that low stress can &apos;t be able to give the best of you and you should be able to fix a system .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that when you &apos;re faced with a medical decision .
We &apos;re all going to be somewhere in a place where they are in the middle of the world .
And I want to talk about .
And if we decide that we need to do that , we need to make a decision to make a decision .
Suppose we &apos;re going to be a doctor , and this says , &quot; &quot; I have the results of the tests and there is a cholesterol high . &quot;
You know , the cholesterol is high , and you can see the cholesterol .
And you can think that the cholesterol is high , it &apos;s not very good , and the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to get a drug that is likely that you &apos;re <unk> them , and you know that they &apos;re one of the drugs that you &apos;re going to call them <unk> .
You would ask a statistical statistics to do something like this .
What is the necessary thing to treat you .
It &apos;s the number of people who have to take a drug before they help you .
And think about what the statistics of statistics is that ?
Number should be one . My doctor wouldn &apos;t get me something that you don &apos;t help .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work like this .
We don &apos;t know what the underlying mechanism is .
<unk> <unk> are estimated that 90 percent of the drugs worked between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So what &apos;s the case in the case that they &apos;re more likely to think about what is it ?
How many people have to take it before you help somebody ?
And this is the second results that they &apos;re looking at .
I even compare the data .
And you think about it , and you &apos;ll be able to see how you think about it .
In the case of this drug , I don &apos;t know what to do .
And they have terrible things . Acute pain on muscles and articulate , <unk> tract — but think about it , &quot; &quot; Five percent . I don &apos;t think I &apos;m gonna get me .
You know , you &apos;ve got 15 times more likely than you know , and you have a higher education than you know , about 15 times more likely than you know that you know .
I &apos;m not saying whether you should take it or don &apos;t tell you whether you should take it or don &apos;t tell you what you need .
Just , you should have this conversation with your doctor .
You have to be able to have access to this information to be able to talk to this information for the future .
But I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m talking about this , and I &apos;m talking about this , and I &apos;m talking about this , and I &apos;m talking about this , and I &apos;m talking about this , and I &apos;m talking about this , and I &apos;m not talking about it .
The prostate cancer cancer , which is 49 .
Yes , there &apos;s to be 49 surgeries for each person who can help .
And the side effects are in this case , and in the 50 percent of patients .
They include bias , intense dysfunctional color .
So the idea of the dead <unk> for the conversation is going .
The ideal is not to have to create all this at the moment .
There are also thinking about subjects like life expectancy .
They are things that we should think of , and talk to the family and loved ones .
Remember : Low blood pressure emits and one of the things that &apos;s going on that moment is that they put a lot of systems .
Evolution gives us an explanation .
Because if the body has <unk> methane in these things and we can &apos;t fix it , and you can &apos;t see it .
Unfortunately , of course , one of the things you call how you gave Danny Danny d <unk> and his colleagues .
So we need training to think of these kinds of situations .
I think the most important is to recognize that we have all of these problems .
And in some time we &apos;re wrong .
The idea is to think antibiotics in which these are the wrong things , to fix systems that can minimize the harm or just be able to avoid these things .
Going back that night with a snow in real mountain , and when I came back about the journey , and the first time I went to the front of the door , and I went back to the front of the door .
They &apos;re not fully organized .
Good day !
Are they concerts ?
Anybody ? No . Well , nothing is nothing .
&quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; in Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; in Arabic &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; in Arabic &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; in Arabic &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; in Arabic &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; in Arabic &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; in Arabic &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; in Arabic &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91; Arabic &#93; &#93; &#91;
And I think about it .
&quot; &quot; See , see , <unk> at this ! &quot; &quot; He said , he said .
It seemed to emphasize that I have to talk to me about my life .
Just one word he did that a young boy was in .
How can you talk about that ?
And so at that moment I began to think .
And it hurt me .
How do we get here ?
And right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now ,
And all of the other people , despite all of the things that we have to do with all of these things .
Or we &apos;re working on the university , and we talk about work . It &apos;s not a language that we have used to be able to use our lives .
But we have another more important reality in the world .
And there are studies that claim to master other languages .
When he started writing in Arabic , he was writing a book .
And all of the other people , I don &apos;t think about it .
And when he started writing in English , and when he started writing in English , and when he started writing in English , and he was writing in English .
When you read their writings in English , you &apos;re going to have an <unk> .
And we can feel that the same person who is the person who is , and that &apos;s what it is .
Second , they say it &apos;s killing their language .
This reality is in the developing societies .
The arab people , the French , the <unk> , the <unk> people in the United states .
And this thought was even more of us , but I &apos;d like to make that world , but I would like to show you a new world .
To make that world developed developed , like Turkey , <unk> and others , who have given them to their language as long as we were interested in ; <unk> <unk> .
They kept their <unk> .
Because if we took any product product we know it &apos;s not a local product .
No one believed it was a local product .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to be consumers , consumers , ignorant , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
There are lots of specific feelings , and there are lots of specific elements that we can do .
Language is not one , two or three words or letters in the line .
Or if a child got her and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In English &quot; &quot; You were living when people went to the street saying &quot; &quot; <unk> in English . &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , it &apos;s better than stop and leave you .
What I want to say is that these expressions can give a specific language .
I have a friend of speech speaking , with a French .
Once I asked him what was all over .
And he said , &quot; &quot; All right , but once I spent a night before I was able to understand what would happen ?
We understand that she &apos;s not able to tell him to her husband , and it &apos;s normal that he doesn &apos;t understand ; his way of thinking is different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; He listens to me with me , and one night , I would translate the mirror that I could feel as I am at listening to the <unk> . &quot; &quot; The poor integrated into this . &quot; &quot; The poor integrated into this .
( Applause ) Well , what do we do to protect the arab language ?
We &apos;re trying to implement civil society , and we need to make a better society .
Still , many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you worry about ?
Let &apos;s think of it , and that &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no problem ! &quot;
In the campaign to <unk> the arab spring , &quot; &quot; Why is it ?
We don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No , we don &apos;t accept this or or a guy . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t use that style because that way not to understand .
And when somebody talks about it , I hate the arab .
We say , ( Applause ) we say we want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day day .
So , how do we think about ourselves and how we think about it , we think .
After that came out of the photos of young girls and girls wearing old characters .
( Laughter ) Photos of young girls and girls &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; In English .
We &apos;re a lot of &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; In English .
And anyone who says , &quot; &quot; Hey , do you do a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopted the word &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying what you want to do , but I proposed to the most beautiful word and I fit the reality with reality .
I &apos;ll follow the Internet .
Or what are you think they have authority about us , when you look at the language , you can see what &apos;s happening .
Creativity in language is the way .
Let &apos;s start with it right now .
One sounds like that sounds pretty global .
It could take the arab again .
But we have to know it , and we &apos;ve been convinced that there &apos;s a solution , and that &apos;s what we have to do in it .
So , well , what can you do today ?
Let &apos;s see — how do you <unk> it ?
Please , I would ask it , even though my time has just ended up .
But I don &apos;t write in Arabic with common themes on the numbers .
( Applause ) It &apos;s a lot of fun . It &apos;s not a language .
They were entering in virtual world with virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back from that world and <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
Now , the next baby , first , the next baby , first of the father , the baby , the baby , the baby , the baby , the baby , the baby &apos;s baby .
So when I son my son , he said , &quot; &quot; This is my grandmother , my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I really said , &quot; &quot; This must be a little bit mad , honest . &quot;
What &apos;s happening in the mind of the baby ?
If we asked this about 30 years ago , most of the people , psychologist <unk> , would you say this baby is irrational , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;ll be able to tell you a little bit of a story or a person , and I wouldn &apos;t understand a process of harm .
In the last 20 years , the development of development has struck by all this .
In a way , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the thought of most scientific scientists .
And I &apos;m going to take an example of this .
One thing I could be able to think about this baby , which could be happening in his mind , is to address what &apos;s happening in the other doctor &apos;s mind .
After the cable , one of the most difficult things for all of us is to address what other people think and feel .
And perhaps the hardest thing is to realize that others think and it &apos;s not the same as what we think and feel .
And so , if you &apos;re so much about politics , you can ask the hard things to do it for some people .
We wanted to know if babies and small children can understand this very complex idea of other people .
The thing is , how can we ask questions ?
Babies aren &apos;t talking , and if we asked for a three-year-old child who tells us what we &apos;re just going to be able to think about is that we can only be a thought of <unk> on the <unk> , we <unk> and things for style .
How can we then ask them ?
It turns out the secret was the <unk> .
Bettina <unk> , one of my students , and more I gave them a few weeks with food : one with <unk> <unk> .
All the babies , even in Berkeley , they have the <unk> and they don &apos;t like the <unk> .
( Laughter ) Then , what did it was to be fed food for two .
And I made it like I loved it .
Half of the time , they did that I love the <unk> and not the <unk> — like any baby or normal person .
But the other half , I took a little bit of <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;ve got the <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then I took a few miles away , and they said , &quot; &quot; Hello , no , no .
I &apos;ve got the <unk> . They , no . &quot; &quot; That was , &quot; &quot; It was like I would like the opposite of what I &apos;d like to do for the babies .
We did this with a bunch of 15 and 18 months .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know what ? &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ll be a little bit ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) and then I knew that I was a little bit more like this .
The thing is , they would babies know what they &apos;d like to do for or or her ?
The surprising thing was that babies were 18 months ago , they just start to start to walk and speak , and they gave us the <unk> , they had the <unk> , they had the <unk> , and they didn &apos;t like the <unk> .
On the other hand , the babies from 15 months had been looking for it as it looked like he had to eat the broccoli , as if I couldn &apos;t get it .
And after looking at a long mouse , I showed up , what would you like to see the whole world .
So , there are two data points on this .
On one side is that babies and 18 months have already discovered this important important human nature : that we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , they understand that they should act to help other people to do what they want .
And more interestingly , though , is that the babies of 15 months don &apos;t do this ; and that suggests that children from 18 months have learned this deep deep age of humans in the three months that separate them from babies from 15 months .
So babies can know more and more than we thought to until now .
And this is just one of the studies that have done in the last 20 years to prove this .
What if you &apos;re asking now is , why kids learn so much ?
And how is it possible you learn how to learn so much time ?
I mean , the first view , babies seemed quite useless .
And in many instances , they are worse than useless , because we have to use a lot of time and energy only in them alive .
If we refuse to evolution for the response to the answer to this mystery , why we &apos;ve lost so much time to push their babies , it turns out that there is a answer to us that we &apos;re going to do .
If you look at different species different species , not only other cousins like us , but also other mammals , birds , even <unk> like the beatles or the <unk> , it turns out that there are relationship between the duration of the childhood , the size of the brain and the intelligence and the flexibility and the flexibility in the species .
One example of this took these birds that you can see here .
For one band we have joshua &apos;s <unk> .
Es and other <unk> , <unk> , paste , and so forth , are birds .
In some ways they &apos;re so intelligent as chimpanzees .
And this is a very strict bird who has learned to use tools to get food .
On the other hand , we have our <unk> domestic burden .
Chickens , like the pathology , dread and <unk> , are stupid as stone .
They &apos;re very little insecure <unk> , but they &apos;re not very good at making anything else .
It turns out that babies are from <unk> from new York than the other , the ones that I &apos;ve been looking for .
They depend on their mouths to watch the worms in the mouth to the two years of life , which is a pretty good lifespan in a bird .
But again , galileo are adult in just a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason that <unk> are finished in the airport &apos; scientific journal that <unk> himself .
There &apos;s something about long childhood that seems to be linked to knowledge and learning .
What explains what could we have for this ?
Some animals , like the brake , they seem to make a very good thing .
So <unk> are very good at <unk> in a particular environment .
Other creatures , like lassa virus , it &apos;s not particularly good doing doing particular , but they &apos;re very good at learning the normal standards .
And of course , human beings are very far away in that distribution .
We have better brains with our body , much more than any other animal .
Add more smarter , more efficient , we can learn more and more , we can survive in much more energy : we &apos;ve got to all over the planet and even even space .
And our babies and children depend on us for a longer longer than babies than babies .
My son is 23 .
( Laughter ) At least to 23 , we &apos;re going to just put them in those red worms in the open mouths of their own .
So well , why are we looking at this correlation ?
One idea is that that strategy , the strategy of learning , is a really powerful way to reform in this world , but it has a huge disadvantage .
It turns out that until it learns everything , if you &apos;re thinking about it , you &apos;re not aware of it .
Wouldn &apos;t it be good that you can get a <unk> and be thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve taken a <unk> or a <unk> ?
It would be better knowing all the time before you are the <unk> .
And the way that evolution evolved solved this problem , it seems to be , with a job division .
So we have this period of time that we &apos;re completely totally different .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . You just learn .
And then , in adults , we can take this one that we learn from babies and children and put it in practical way to get out around the world .
One way to think about this is that babies and small children are like the research department and development in the human species .
They &apos;re the <unk> people who do research , those who have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and trade .
We have to take all these ideas that we learn from children and putting them in practice .
Another way to see is , instead of thinking about babies and children as adults as well as mice , they think about them as a way of living in the different ways of the same species — like the random them and the taliban , but babies would be the <unk> that were radiating out by the garden paths .
If this is true , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution shows us that , that &apos;s the children are to learn , we can hope that you &apos;re going to learn a lot of really interesting strategies .
And in fact , the brain of a baby seems to be the computer of the most powerful learning of the planet .
Even though the actual computers are getting better .
There &apos;s a revolution in our way to understand the machines machine .
And all of the ideas of this man is , he &apos;s Thomas Thomas , who was a <unk> and a <unk> story in the 18th century .
Traditionally , calories provided a mathematical mathematical that was originally the subject of the probability to character and describe the way that scientists have found out of the world .
What scientists have to do is to get a hypothesis , something that will power start .
Then they get that hypothesis with them .
You know , you can tell you how to change the hypothesis , the hypothesis I &apos;m going to tell you , what can you do ?
And I &apos;m going to show you a lot more about what &apos;s going on .
What you showed , it &apos;s an mathematical procedure that could do that .
And mathematics is the basis of learning that we have today .
Ten years ago , suggested that babies were supposed to be doing the same .
If you want to know what &apos;s going down at this little little little <unk> , I think , is something that looks very similar to me , and I think that &apos;s something very similar to me .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) and I &apos;ve seen this in the late 1980s .
I think babies are doing very complicated calculations with highly intelligent tests that are navigated and so find out how the world works .
Well , this is even more difficult to demonstrate .
If you ask a adults about statistics , you can feel very stupid .
How is that possible ?
To test this , we use a machine that we &apos;ve called <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a box that &apos;s going to light and sounds like it &apos;s wearing a particular pattern .
By using this simple machine , in my lab , and in other labs , there &apos;s dozens of studies on the good news that are the children learning learning about the world .
I &apos;m going to show you just one of what we &apos;ve done with an <unk> , one of my students .
If you show you this detector probably probably a little bit more likely to think about how the shape of it is to put a block on the detector .
But the case is the detector works in a way a strange star .
If you could get a block out of the detector , something that you wouldn &apos;t think in a principle , the detector is two of three times .
So when you put it up to the block , what would the logic be , only if it &apos;s two of six times .
So chances are more likely to be more accurate .
It looks like the strategy to shake the object is more effectively than the other .
So we explain this data to four children and we give them to try them .
And with security , the four children who were used to data and pull out the object out of the detector .
There are two interesting data in this way .
The first , you remember that you are four years old , and I think that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking for .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re learning about .
But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing complex calculations that have a lot of exclusive tests .
The second interesting thing is that they &apos;re using the test to get an idea , to a hypothesis on the world , which seems to be a little bit likely to the principle .
In studies that we test in the lab , other similar conversations , we &apos;ve shown that these children &apos;s four are better better than finding a lot of chances of adults , given the same task .
In these circumstances , the children are statistics to discuss things about the world , but scientists have experienced , after all , and we wanted to see if children have had too .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; Or &quot; &quot; Play . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a lot of many interesting research recently that shows that these games are as a kind of research program .
We show one of the legal lab .
He delivered a new <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It showed the kids that the yellow <unk> it was working and the red , no , showing up an absolute <unk> .
What we &apos;re going to see is this one <unk> <unk> in two minutes .
Child : And that ?
Child : Equal to the other side .
Journalist : Well , the first hypothesis that you would see .
Child : Nothing . ( Laughter ) Child : this bacterium that &apos;s going on , but this is not .
Journalist : I &apos;m describing to the experiment .
Child : Why do you do that ?
( Laughter ) Child : I don &apos;t understand .
Journalist : Scientists will recognize that face of despair .
( Laughter ) Child : oh , that &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
Journalist : List , 2 .
Child : That &apos;s going to be .
Child : Oh ...
( Laughter ) Journalist : the next picture .
He asked the researchers that he tried to put it on the other .
Neither didn &apos;t work .
Child : Oh , that &apos;s because light is going to go down here , right here .
Underneath this box is electricity , but this is no one .
Journalist : Well , that would be the fourth fourth chance .
Child : Now .
If you put a lot together .
If you put your baby four inside , then you saw that and then you go to the other .
Journalist : Well , that &apos;s the fifth hypothesis .
This child is — it &apos;s a very high child , and <unk> , but <unk> has found that it &apos;s very typical .
If you look at how you play a child , you &apos;re going to ask them to explain something , what do they do for them .
It &apos;s very good for four years .
Well , what if you feel like this kind of creature ?
What if we were to be able to find out five people that are going to be five years ago , they &apos;re looking at five minutes ago ?
If we go back to the theory of psychologists and philosophers , you know , you know what babies and kids are just conscious , or even though they &apos;re not absolute .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and children are more aware of the adults .
This is what we know about how it works .
Awareness and attention from an adult looks like a focus .
What happens in adults is that when we decide that something is important or relevant , we pay attention .
Consciousness is on what we &apos;re going to navigate , and the nsa , the rest of the rest you see .
We also know how this is in the brain .
When we present attention to something , the brain of the brain , the part of the brain , the part of the brain , the signal that makes a small part of the brain if it &apos;s going to be better , if you go longer and more and more , more to learn , and turn out in activity in the rest of the brain .
So we have this very carefully , very careful attention to the purpose .
If you look at babies and children , you see something very different .
I think babies and children seem to have a more awareness more like a lantern in a focus .
The babies and children have really limited to pay attention to a single thing .
But it &apos;s very good for you to have a lot of data on that much of information .
And if you look at your brain , what you see is that there are songs in a neurotransmitter that scale to learning and plasticity , and that inhibits is not slowing down .
So when we say that babies and children have problems to pay attention , what really means is that they &apos;re not paying attention .
They tend to get out of the interesting things that they could be able to say something to look at what &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of awareness that we should expect , as often as the ones that are designed to learn .
If we want to think about a kind of feeling of child sensitivity like adults , and I think the best way is to think about that we are in a new situation where we haven &apos;t seen it ; we have to live a lot of people , or when we &apos;re going to be a city for the first time .
In fact , consciousness doesn &apos;t matter , but it spread , so it seems like three days in Paris there is more awareness and experience that in every year around the house , walking through , starting to class class as first .
So right , that cup , that magnificent boy that we take down , actually , the effect of the neurotransmitter of the babies .
So how do you be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being bullied in Paris , for the first time , after taking three points .
( Laughter ) A wonderful sensation , but it used to wait to cry for three o &apos;clock .
But it &apos;s going to be adult .
I don &apos;t mean to be too much about the magnificent ones that are the babies .
It &apos;s going to be adult .
We can do things like tying yourself shoes or crossing the street .
And it makes sense that we have a lot of effort in doing that babies can think of as adults .
But if we want to be like these , these are the ones that have the <unk> , the open mind , to open open , to be open to learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , perhaps , by the way , we &apos;re beginning to do adults adults in a little bit like children .

These are simple objects : solo , keys , lenses and lenses .
They are the things that the victims of the rwandan genocide was going to be the same .
We &apos;re all used to these thousands of years around the world .
The fact that some victims took up body objects like the shepherd or the <unk> of a teeth is a signal that didn &apos;t have a sense of what was going on .
They used to tell them that they would be <unk> .
These objects recovered from a bunch of common land of my land , and we talk , and we are talking about the <unk> of bodies of the new common resources that are found 20 years after the war .
And they &apos;re perhaps the biggest discovered that we &apos;ve seen in the world .
For the four years of the conflict that <unk> <unk> in the 1990s , a 75 million citizens , civil population , most of our lives , civil rights , most of them , disappeared , 10,000 deaths were killed by the operations operation .
The most <unk> were in the first days of war , or right on the end of the conflict , <unk> in hand hands hands .
The international <unk> court officer affected a crime for humanity and genocide and genocide , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re not working .
Genome is the systematic destruction and <unk> of a ethnic group , French , rational and racist .
Genome is so hard to kill her as an artist .
And the answer is that it &apos;s not the same because the destruction of the property of the cultural heritage , and in fact that any of the sign of his own existence is the most important thing that we need .
The genocide is not only the killing ; it &apos;s denial of the identity of identity or not .
There &apos;s always hints , there &apos;s no crime crime , there &apos;s no crime crime .
They &apos;re always just <unk> from the <unk> that their most <unk> , or our <unk> and the weak memorial .
These objects have made a lot of common common ground , and the aim of remembering is this one of the most relevant process that disappeared , in the first act of genocide for Europe for the Holocaust for the moment .
No one should be without having to figure out or not identify how to do it .
Once we went into these objects that victims were moving into their own performance , they were reminded that they &apos;re going to get them out .
Thousands of them put on the plastic bag of plastic as you see it in a bag of plastic that you see in a plastic tree .
It &apos;s used by how tools they can relate to the visual visual effects , but also as valuable as the <unk> of the war
Sometimes it &apos;s called <unk> , but the visual recognize is a tough , inefficient , painful process .
Once you &apos;re in charge , doctors and lawyers end up to be <unk> in storytelling .
Many <unk> , if you don &apos;t create a <unk> or a <unk> and just outside of the mind of the mind .
A few years ago I decided to photograph each more of the object to create a visual interface that are <unk> together .
I like to promote awareness of consciousness .
And in this case , you can recognize the objects or at least less than the photos are <unk> , highly <unk> and <unk> of what happened .
Photography was empathy and family of these objects will pass it .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a <unk> , if you want it , and the result is the closest possible to a very short point .
When you identify as the <unk> is going to get the <unk> off of the body , you don &apos;t break it up , and you can see it in the body .
In all its simplicity objects , we &apos;re looking for the identity of the victims of the last times , until that &apos;s the case of what people have had .
Thank you very much .

So a few years ago I decided to follow the footprints of the great philosopher philosopher <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot;
There are some things I &apos;ve learned to have about 30 days .
That the months didn &apos;t happen in the <unk> , forgotten , if not the time was much more memorable .
This belongs to my challenge of taking a photograph every day during a month .
Never would have been so close by that , but it &apos;s not something like this .
I also understood .
For sure , the secret is in sleeping .
But you end up on your novel .
It &apos;s terrible .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m an <unk> computer . &quot;
No . I mean , I &apos;m a writer .
I learned how to make small and affordable change , is more likely to maintain forever .
In fact , they &apos;re great fun .

I &apos;m here to share my <unk> .
Is this photograph ?
Because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t get out of their cameras .
With all , my interest in imaging began started when I first got my first digital camera at 15 years .
I want to play with my vision of the first letter , but more recently , a little bit different , because by using the camera camera was more good at design .
And when you take a picture of a camera , the process is when you take the camera .
For me , photography was more likely to be in the best place , at the moment .
It would just be that anybody could do .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process begins to reward the wrist .
Photos like this : a building on a very hot road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And despite this , it &apos;s a <unk> level .
Or photos like these — listen and present time , but all of the common characteristics of keeping the stress rate .
When I say that I say goodbye .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can actually be captured , but I always want it that it was captured in a way as a photograph .
And there was a few years ago that I &apos;ve been thinking about to understand the magic .
So this is more likely to look at an idea that we can capture a very simple moment .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it seem real ?
Do you have to see the details or the colors .
Do you have to see with light ?
What is the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But at the end of the end it &apos;s our way to interpret the world and how it can be understood in a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s really not about whether it &apos;s a <unk> , but what we think is a realist .
So I think the basics are very simple .
I see how a puzzle reveals reality when we take different pieces of reality and together together to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
So here we have three main objects objects right now , something that we can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined with a way that we can make something that is really three-dimensional ; it &apos;s like it can exist .
But at the same time , we know that it can &apos;t exist .
So we add to the brain because the brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that that really doesn &apos;t make sense .
And I see the same process by adding pictures .
It really is about engaging in different differences .
So the things that make a picture looks like , I believe that these are those who we don &apos;t even know ; the things that us in us in our life lives .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to have in this account , because in the contrary , they seem to be rare in ways .
So I &apos;d like to say that there are three simple approaches that we &apos;re going to get to find out .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , you can create something like this .
So the first step is that the photo photos have to have the same perspective .
Secondly , the photo photos must have the same kind of light .
And these two images have done with these requirements , they have been out of the same time and the same type of light .
The third point is to be impossible to tell where they eat it all the different images with a perfect bond .
It has to be impossible to say how to imagine the reality in reality .
Doing the color , the contrast , the contrast to the edges that there are different kinds of images , including defending defenses like the depth of the field , colors of chocolate and <unk> , rubber the boundaries between the different images and we see that it sounds like this sounds , but despite the fact that a sounds of reality may have hundreds of pairs .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) You might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom part is what it &apos;s manipulated .
But this picture is completely composed of different places .
Now , I think it &apos;s easier to make a place to find a place to find it because it doesn &apos;t have to compromise the ideas that has in the head .
But this requires a lot of plans .
And as I thought this idea in the winter , I knew that I had several months to design , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
For example , the fish was captured in an exit fishing .
The backs are a different favorite .
The <unk> part was captured in a rock .
And yes , you did have a red house at the island of the island so they would look smaller .
So to get a result of a realistic result , I think it &apos;s necessary .
It &apos;s always going to be a <unk> , a picture .
So we need to combine the different pictures .
And here each piece is very well .
If one made a job job by taking the pictures that can be very beautiful and very carefully .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that limit our Action is our imagination .
Thank you .

On this slide , you have to take your age on the horizontal axis .
After puberty , we left the map .
And as a result , we &apos;ve been using all the world that we &apos;re using all the world .
And the distribution of a Japanese is completely different than the human being .
It changes our models of the critical period of the critical period .
We had to set up a group of control that we have to do .
But we asked questions about what &apos;s role .
And another group that has only been exposed to a audience that was just a computer .
What you see here is the result of the audience , which is the best thing to do .
It &apos;s six months .
( Laughter ) The different regions of the brain in the brain , which are the fact that one of the fact that you &apos;ve seen it is .
